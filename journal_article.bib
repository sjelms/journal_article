  abstract  = "Virtual Training Systems have emerged as alternative tools for
               construction equipment operator training that may reduce costs,
               avoid risks, and provide flexible environments for various
               training purposes. However, principles for determining
               training-schedule design for efficient utilization of these
               systems are not well established. The present research compared
               performance of two groups, one adopting a mixed practice
               schedule (with high contextual interference) and the other
               employing a blocked practice schedule (presumably with lower
               contextual interference) for learning construction excavator
               control skills in a computer-based virtual environment. No
               significant difference was found with regard to achieved skill
               level and skill consistency. A possible reason is that the
               complexity of the training task created a degree of intra-task
               interference in the blocked practice schedule comparable to the
               interference created by the mixed practice schedule. This result
               implies a need to further assay construction equipment operation
               to critically isolate influences on operator skill development.",

                 climate change mitigation. It remains unclear where and in
                 which way the additional demand for wooden construction
                 material shall be fulfilled. Here we assess the global and
                 regional impacts of increased demand for engineered wood on
                 land use and associated CO2 emissions until 2100 using an
                 open-source land system model. We show that if 90\% of the new
                 urban population would be housed in newly built urban mid-rise
                 buildings with wooden constructions, 106 Gt of additional CO2
                 could be saved by 2100. Forest plantations would need to
                 expand by up to 149 Mha by 2100 and harvests from unprotected
                 natural forests would increase. Our results indicate that
                 expansion of timber plantations for wooden buildings is
                 possible without major repercussions on agricultural
                 production. Strong governance and careful planning are

                 A quasi-experimental pre-posttest control group design was

               intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). Many of those systems have
               tackled fundamental subjects such as mathematics, physics, and
               computer programming. The change of the student's cognitive
               behavior over time, however, has not been considered and modeled
               systematically. Furthermore, the nature of domain knowledge in
               specific subjects such as orthopedic surgery, in which pragmatic
               knowledge could play an important role, has also not been taken
               into account deliberately. We believe that the temporal
               dimension in modeling the student's knowledge state and
               cognitive behavior is critical, especially in such domains. In
               this paper, we propose an approach for student modeling and
               diagnosis, which is based on a symbiosis between temporal
               Bayesian networks and fine-grained didactic analysis. The latter
               may help building a powerful domain knowledge model and the
               former may help modeling the learner's complex cognitive
               behavior, so as to be able to provide him or her with relevant
               feedback during a problem-solving process. To illustrate the
               application of the approach, we designed and developed several
               key components of an intelligent learning environment for
               teaching the concept of sacro-iliac screw fixation in orthopedic
               surgery, for which we videotaped and analyzed six surgical
               interventions in a French hospital. A preliminary gold-standard

               practices adopted by the construction industry continue to be
               substantially manual. Project information is primarily exchanged
               via paper documents, and the visualization of the facility is
               marginally communicated using 2D drawings. Functions are
               generally planned independently of one another. Previous
               research efforts developed systems that are characterized as
               responsive decision systems, relying mainly on programmed

               effective form of instruction. Three contrasting hypotheses, a
               tutor-centered one, a student-centered one, and an interactive
               one could all potentially explain the effectiveness of tutoring.
               To test these hypotheses, analyses focused not only on the
               effectiveness of the tutors' moves, but also on the
               effectiveness of the students' construction on learning, as well
               as their interaction. The interaction hypothesis is further
               tested in the second study by manipulating the kind of tutoring
               tactics tutors were permitted to use. In order to promote a more
               interactive style of dialogue, rather than a didactic style,
               tutors were suppressed from giving explanations and feedback.
               Instead, tutors were encouraged to prompt the students.
               Surprisingly, students learned just as effectively even when
               tutors were suppressed from giving explanations and feedback.
               Their learning in the interactive style of tutoring is
               attributed to construction from deeper and a greater amount of
               scaffolding episodes, as well as their greater effort to take
               control of their own learning by reading more. What they learned

               enhance/maintain the learning needs (e.g., lack of knowledge or
               skill) of each individual. Today, ITSs are generally developed
               to support desktop training applications, with the most common
               domains involving cognitive problem solving tasks (e.g.,
               mathematics and physics). In recent years, implementations of
               game-based tutors authored using the Generalized Intelligent
               Framework for Tutoring (GIFT), an open-source tutoring
               architecture, provided tailored training experiences for
               military tasks through desktop applications (e.g., games
               including Virtual Battlespace and Virtual Medic). However, these
               game-based desktop tutors have also been limited to adaptive
               instruction for cognitive tasks (e.g., problem solving and
               decision-making). The military requires adaptive instruction to
               extend beyond the desktop to be compatible with the physical
               nature of many tasks performed by soldiers, sailors, and airmen.
               This article examines how commercial sensor technologies might
               be adapted to work with GIFT and support tailored
               computer-guided instruction in the psychomotor domain for a
               military medical training task, specifically hemorrhage control.
               Toward this goal, we evaluated the usability and system features
               of commercial smart glasses and pressure-sensing technologies.
               Smart glasses were selected as the focus of this study over
               handheld mobile devices in order to promote a hands-free
               experience during the training of hemorrhage-control tasks on a
               mannequin. Pressure sensors were selected to provide direct
               measures of effectiveness during the application of tourniquets
               and pressure bandages. Each set of technologies (smart glasses
               and pressure sensors) was evaluated not with respect to each
               other, but with respect to their capabilities to support
               adaptive instruction in the wild at the learner?s point-of-need
               and criteria based on established usability heuristics.

               capabilities, and evaluated their compatibility with the
               hemorrhage-control task, to answer the following question: what
               system design features (e.g., usability and interaction) are
               needed to support adaptive instruction for this individual

  abstract  = "The ability to visualize in three dimensions is a cognitive
               skill that has been shown to be important for success in
               engineering and other technological fields. For engineering, the
               ability to mentally rotate 3?D objects is especially important.
               Unfortunately, of all the cognitive skills, 3?D rotation
               abilities exhibit robust gender differences, favoring males. The
               assessment of 3?D spatial skills and associated gender
               differences has been a topic of educational research for nearly
               a century; however, a great deal of the previous work has been
               aimed at merely identifying differences. The author has been
               conducting applied research in the area of spatial skills
               development for more than a decade aimed at identifying
               practical methods for improving 3?D spatial skills, especially
               for women engineering students. This paper details the
               significant findings obtained over the past several years
               through this research and identifies strategies that appear to
               be effective in developing 3?D spatial skills and in
               contributing to student success.",

               regular practices. These systems and the learning activities

               classrooms, through multiple cycles of prototyping and testing.

               However, experience-based learning of dangerous situations is

              implementation and research in existing buildings. This paper
              presents a review of over 180 recent publications on the topic.
              Results show scarce BIM implementation in existing buildings yet,
              due to challenges of (1) high modeling/conversion effort from
              captured building data into semantic BIM objects, (2) updating of

              Augmented Reality technology has been applied in many application

              Reality systems: An experimental study",
  author   = "Chu, Michael and Matthews, Jane and Love, Peter E D",
  abstract = "Abstract The benefits of Building Information Modelling (BIM)
              have typically been tied to its capability to support information
              structuring and exchange through the centralization of
              information. Its increasing adoption and the associated ease of
              data acquisition has created information intensive work
              environments, which can result in information overload and thus
              negatively impact workers task efficiency during construction.
              Augmented Reality (AR) has been proposed as a mechanism to
              enhance the process of information extraction from building
              information models to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
              workers' tasks. Yet, there is limited research that has evaluated
              the effectiveness and usability of AR in this domain. This
              research aims to address this gap and evaluate the effectiveness
              of BIM and AR system integration to enhance task efficiency
              through improving the information retrieval process during
              construction. To achieve this, a design science research approach
              was adopted that enabled the development and performance of a
              mobile BIM AR system (artefact) with cloud-based storage
              capabilities to be tested and evaluated using a portable desktop
              experiment. A total of 20 participants compared existing manual
              information retrieval methods (control group), with information
              retrieval through the artefact (non-control group). The results
              revealed that the participants using the artefact were
              approximately 50\% faster in completing their experiment tasks,
              and committed less errors, when compared to the control group.
              This research demonstrates that a minor modification to existing
              information formats (2D plans) with the inclusion of Quick
              Response markers can significantly improve the information
              retrieval process and that BIM and AR integration has the
              potential to enhance task efficiency.",

  abstract = "Abstract Augmented reality (AR), a state-of-the-art technology
              for superimposing information onto the real world, has recently
              started to affect our daily lives. AR applications are becoming
              mature and versatile. This paper discusses trends in AR
              applications for architecture, engineering, construction, and
              facility management (AEC/FM). This paper specifically focuses on
              four technologies---localization, natural user interface (NUI),
              cloud computing, and mobile devices---which have the potential to
              influence the development of AR applications. Advances in
              localization technology will enable the deployment of AR in a
              complex environment. An NUI provides more convenient and
              intuitive user experiences, which can increase the usability of
              AR. Cloud computing environments allow users with internet access
              to ubiquitously retrieve information from almost anywhere. Hence,
              cloud computing increases the freedom of using AR in AEC/FM
              applications. Another factor that will lead to the wider usage of
              AR is that mobile devices are becoming smaller, more powerful,
              and less expensive. This paper summarizes the results of 101
              research efforts, and outlines the research trends and

              introduced as one of the possible new tools for educating the
              upcoming generation in many different fields. Specifically,
              construction management education has attempted to use simulation

  abstract = "Purpose New methods to introduce topics in classrooms are needed
              to enhance the construction management educational experience.
              One of these new methods is showing real time videos that
              highlight the various elements of concern in the classroom
              lecture. The purpose of this paper is to use augmented reality
              technology (ART) and a layer of artificial visualizations to
              simulate the environmental context and spatio-temporal
              constraints of various construction processes. The
              superimposition of images serves as an instructional mechanism to
              virtually incorporate jobsite experiences into classrooms. This
              enhancement of spatio-temporal constraints enables learners to
              visualize context and hidden processes otherwise unattainable
              through traditional classroom lectures.
              Design/methodology/approach A significantly improved perception
              of reality is created through the combination of the learners'
              ability to understand the complexity of construction products
              (e.g. assemblies) and associated jobsite processes by viewing the
              real environment augmented with computer-generated information
              layers. Findings Testing the ART video in a classroom with
              undergraduate construction management students showed that
              students who were exposed to the ART video were able to remember
              and identify the highlighted elements in the corresponding
              assembly more effectively than those who were not.
              Originality/value ART is a valuable tool in enhancing classroom
              learning and gives educators a teaching advantage when they
              combine traditional classroom lectures with ART enabled media.",

  abstract = "Abstract Construction is a high hazard industry which involves
              many factors that are potentially dangerous to workers. Safety
              has always been advocated by many construction companies, and
              they have been working hard to make sure their employees are
              protected from fatalities and injuries. With the advent of
              Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR), there has been a witnessed
              trend of capitalizing on sophisticated immersive VR/AR
              applications to create forgiving environments for visualizing
              complex workplace situations, building up risk-preventive
              knowledge and undergoing training. To better understand the
              state-of-the-art of VR/AR applications in construction safety
              (VR/AR-CS) and from which to uncover the related issues and
              propose possible improvements, this paper starts with a review
              and synthesis of research evidence for several VR/AR prototypes,
              products and the related training and evaluation paradigms.
              Predicated upon a wide range of well-acknowledged scholarly
              journals, this paper comes up with a generic taxonomy consisting
              of VR/AR technology characteristics, application domains, safety
              scenarios and evaluation methods. According to this taxonomy, a
              number of technical features and types that could be implemented
              in the context of construction safety enhancement are derived and
              further elaborated, while significant application domains and
              trends regarding the VR/AR-CS research are generalized, i.e.,
              hazards recognition and identification, safety training and
              education, safety instruction and inspection, and so on. Last but
              not least, this study sets forth a list of gaps derived from the
              in-depth review and comes up with the prospective research works.
              It is envisioned that the outcomes of this paper could assist
              both researchers and industrial practitioners with appreciating
              the research and practice frontier of VR/AR-CS and soliciting the

  abstract = "Abstract Building Information Modeling (BIM) techniques have
              enabled the construction industry to realize various benefits.
              However, most projects still rely on 2D drawings to communicate
              the 3D BIM content to construction personnel. While Mixed Reality
              (MR) could theoretically be the primary means of communicating
              BIM content to onsite personnel in 3D, there is not currently a
              thorough understanding of how this might impact the construction
              performance of industry practitioners. This paper explores this
              topic by examining the field of electrical construction. It
              addresses research questions related to: MR's influence on the
              productivity and quality of electrical conduit construction; and
              the effects of an industry practitioner's background on his or
              her performance using MR. To address these topics, a
              quasi-experiment was conducted that compares the performance of
              eighteen electrical construction personnel who were tasked with
              building similar conduit assemblies using traditional paper and
              MR. Participants completed pre- and post-activity questionnaires
              to provide their perceptions of the experience. The results
              suggest that MR enabled: a significantly higher productivity
              rate; reduced the time required to understand the design; led to
              fewer errors during the assembly process; and increased the
              number of accurately constructed conduits as compared to the
              conduits constructed using traditional paper. Additionally,
              nearly all participants agreed that MR is easy to use, but most
              still felt that they would prefer to use paper plans for design
              communication. The findings of this work were noteworthy because
              many of the participants had substantial prior experience
              constructing conduit using paper plans, yet they still performed
              the task better and faster using MR. While the small sample size
              limits the extent to which these findings can be generalized, the
              contribution of this work is in demonstrating, as a
              proof-of-concept, that MR can be a viable option for
              communicating existing BIM content to current industry
              practitioners and that it can offer advantages that are not
              currently observed through the use of a paper-based communication

              discusses the connection between Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal
              Development (ZPD), and the notion of scaffolding, and explicates
              the differences between scaffolding and scaffolds. The paper then
              presents a discussion of the changes that the notion of
              scaffolding has undergone, especially when it comes to supporting
              students in classroom contexts. In classrooms where one teacher
              supports multiple students, scaffolding is distributed across
              various tools and social scaffolds. A discussion of the notion of
              distributed scaffolding is presented, to describe how students in
              classrooms may be supported by various tools and social
              scaffolds. The paper then introduces the kinds of distribution
              and interactions between tools and social scaffolds that need to
              be considered to support multiple students in classroom contexts.
              Finally, distributed scaffolding is discussed with reference to
              the key features of scaffolding, especially fading and transfer

              behind the numbers to examine the operation of apprenticeship. It
              reviews the evolution of joint programs, including institutional
              arrangements and recent innovations to cope with the challenging
              characteristics of construction labor markets.
              Design/methodology/approach Statistical comparisons by type of
              program sponsor are carried out using individual‐level data on
              registered apprenticeship for the period 1996‐2003. Evolution of
              apprenticeship programs is discussed in a historical perspective.
              Findings Joint programs (with union participation) were found to
              have much higher enrolments and greater participation of women
              and ethnic/racial minorities. Joint programs also exhibit
              markedly better performance for all groups on rates of attrition

              productivity model based on multilayer feedforward neural
              networks trained with a backpropagation algorithm by which
              complex mapping of factors to labor productivity is performed. To
              prevent networks from overfitting and improve their
              generalization, early stopping and Bayesian regularization are
              implemented and compared. The results proved a better prediction
              performance for Bayesian regularization than early stopping. To
              demonstrate the prediction performance of the presented models,
              the developed models are implemented at two real power plant

              neural network models and to identify the most influential
              factors a sensitivity analysis is conducted. This paper focuses

              processes, where the size of the design is strictly constrained

              pronounced in the building and construction industry, where it is
              impractical to have printers that are larger than actual

              creates potential weaknesses at the assembly interfaces. In this

               eye tracking technology is being applied more frequently in
               cognitive research such as hazard identification. These studies
               typically use eye tracking in a diagnostic way and pay less
               attention to the application of virtual environment. However, in
               virtual environment, eye tracking not only can enhance the study
               of the cognitive process but also improves the human-computer
               interaction. Therefore, this paper elaborates on how we use eye
               tracking devices to track 3D objects in virtual environments
               diagnostically and interactively. First, we analyze the existing
               research gaps of using eye tracking in the construction
               industry. Then, we follow 3D object identification, diagnostic
               mode and interactive mode to develop a methodology by HTC VIVE
               device with Pupil Labs HTC Vive Binocular Add-on based on the
               research gaps. Finally, an example experiment is provided to
               demonstrate studying hazard identification using eye tracking in
               construction safety. For analyzing the eye movement data from
               the participants, we offer the number of confirmations, the scan
               path and the 3D heatmap of objects in both static and dynamic
               construction site scenes. This paper provides an approach of
               applying eye tracking to gather more data in virtual environment
               for the future cognitive studies and explores the possibility to

              Zone of Proximal Development could be used to inform the design
              of an Interactive Learning Environment called the Ecolab. Two
              aspects of this work have subsequently been used for further
              research. Firstly, there is the interpretation of the ZPD and its
              associated theory that was used to operationalize the ZPD so that
              it could be implemented in software. This interpretation has
              informed further research about how one can model context and its
              impact on learning, which has produced a design framework that
              has been successfully applied across a range of educational
              settings. Secondly, there is the Ecolab software itself. The
              software has been adapted into a variety of versions that have
              supported explorations into how to scaffold learners'
              metacognition, how to scaffold learners' motivation and the
              implications of a learner's goal orientation upon their use of
              the software. The findings from these studies have informed our
              understanding of learner scaffolding and have produced consistent
              results to demonstrate the importance of providing learners with
              appropriately challenging tasks and flexible support. Vygotsky's
              work is as relevant now as it was in 1999: it still has an
              important role to play in the development of educational

              increasingly integrated with artificial intelligence techniques
              in order to develop more personalized educational systems. These
              systems are known as Intelligent Tutoring systems (ITSs). This
              paper focused on the variant characteristics of ITSs developed
              across different educational fields. The original studies from
              2007 to 2017 were extracted from the PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus,
              Google scholar, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases.
              Finally, 53 papers were included in the study based on inclusion
              criteria. The educational fields in the ITSs were mainly computer
              sciences (37.73\%). Action-condition rule-based reasoning, data
              mining, and Bayesian network with 33.96\%, 22.64\%, and 20.75\%
              frequency respectively, were the most frequent artificial
              intelligent techniques applied in the ITSs. These techniques
              enable ITSs to deliver adaptive guidance and instruction,
              evaluate learners, define and update the learner's model, and
              classify or cluster learners. Specifically, the performance of
              the system, learner's performance, and experiences were used for
              evaluation of ITSs. Most ITSs were designed for web user
              interfaces. Although these systems could facilitate reasoning in
              the learning process, these systems have rarely been applied in
              experimental courses including problem-solving, decision-making
              in physics, chemistry, and clinical fields. Due to the important
              role of a cell phone in facilitating personalized learning and
              given the low rate of using mobile-based ITSs, this study has
              recommended the development and evaluation of mobile-based ITSs.",

              and theories of learning and teaching that take place with a
              large number of learners and a high ratio of learners to
              facilitators. The scale of these environments often changes the
              very nature of the interaction and learning experiences. We
              identify three types of technologies that support scale in
              education: dedicated content-agnostic platforms, such as MOOCs;
              dedicated tools, such as Intelligent Tutoring Systems; and
              repurposed platforms, such as social networks. We further
              identify five areas that scale affects: learners, research and
              data, adaptation, space and time, and pedagogy. Introducing the
              papers in this special issue on the topic, we discuss the
              characteristics, affordances, and promise of learning at scale.",

  abstract = "This article is a review of experiments comparing the
              effectiveness of human tutoring, computer tutoring, and no
              tutoring. ``No tutoring'' refers to instruction that teaches the
              same content without tutoring. The computer tutoring systems were
              divided by their granularity of the user interface interaction
              into answer-based, step-based, and substep-based tutoring
              systems. Most intelligent tutoring systems have step-based or
              substep-based granularities of interaction, whereas most other
              tutoring systems (often called CAI, CBT, or CAL systems) have
              answer-based user interfaces. It is widely believed as the
              granularity of tutoring decreases, the effectiveness increases.
              In particular, when compared to No tutoring, the effect sizes of
              answer-based tutoring systems, intelligent tutoring systems, and
              adult human tutors are believed to be d = 0.3, 1.0, and 2.0
              respectively. This review did not confirm these beliefs. Instead,
              it found that the effect size of human tutoring was much lower: d
              = 0.79. Moreover, the effect size of intelligent tutoring systems
              was 0.76, so they are nearly as effective as human tutoring.",

               environment that facilitates unique learning experiences,
               engagement and motivation. However, the study outcome suggests

               the effectiveness of teaching and learning in precision

               patterns for AIeL research with a focus on leading journals,
               countries, disciplines, and applications. In addition, a
               co-citation network analysis was conducted to explore the
               invisible relationships among the core papers of AIeL to reveal
               directions for future research. The analysis is based on a total
               of 86 core AIeL papers accompanied by 1149 citations in
               follow-up studies obtained from the Web of Science. It was found
               that a majority of AIeL studies focused on the development and
               applications of intelligent tutoring systems, followed by using
               AI to facilitate assessment and evaluation in e-learning
               contexts. For field researchers, the visualized network diagram

                 and analyzed to determine potential problems that might impede
                 their use in school-to-work programs. These simulations were
                 classified according to type (e.g., Skill simulations;
                 Role-Playing simulations; and Strategy simulations) and then
                 critiqued regarding common problems in using them (e.g.,
                 usability, learnability, content, and available teacher
                 support). We indicate which problems are most common and what
                 educators can do to overcome them. We close with a
                 propositional analysis of two of the most promising workplace
                 simulations that measures the job-specificity and implicitness
                 of their content. We conclude that simulations can play an
                 important role in school-to-work transition programs, even if
                 not specifically designed for that purpose.",

               주제를 제시하였다. Labor shortages are a serious problem for Korea's
               construction industry. The problem is both quantitative and
               qualitative. There is a shortage in supply as due to a decrease
               in the influx of new labor, and existing workers are less
               productive as they age. The problem will only get worse as more
               and more major public projects are being planned. Options for
               increasing the labor supply are somewhat limited, and thus
               efforts need to be made to adopt new technologies that can
               improve the productivity and efficiency of field work and their
               processes. This paper introduces seven innovation technologies
               that have the best potential to increase productivity and thus
               reduce the burden of labor shortage problems. These include 1)
               Substitution by use of robotics and automation, 2) development
               and applications of Innovative materials to reduce on site field
               work, 3) increase in productivity through the implementation of
               Information Technology, 4) improved productivity through the
               application of modules, and prefabrication, 5) prevention of
               rework and redesign, 6) diversification of labor by integrating
               labor skills, and 7) improved productivity by standardizing site
               processes.",

  abstract  = "The construction industry is facing an unprecedented, nationwide
               shortage of skilled labor. Construction is the second largest
               employer in the country and according to a Construction Industry
               Institute study 75\% of contractors are experiencing labor
               shortages that are manifesting themselves as cost overruns
               and/or schedule delays. This crisis has been a long time coming
               and our current culture has not helped the problem. Young people
               who don't go to college are seen as ``failures,'' and fewer
               native-born Americans want to work with their hands, outdoors?at
               any wage. In fact a group of high school students surveyed about
               attractive careers listed construction 498th out of 500 possible
               occupations. Not only does construction have an image problem,
               but also the workforce composition of the future is largely
               minority and women, a challenge for an industry that is
               dominantly and traditionally white male. In order to face this
               labor shortage head on, the industry must swallow a bitter pill
               ? Change or continue to accept increases in project cost and
               duration. In response to this challenge, several contractors and
               construction entities have begun to develop innovative new
               programs to recruit more individuals to the construction trades,
               including charter schools, community outreach and active
               participation in high school career guidance by apprenticeship
               programs. More construction companies are realizing that
               diversity practices add economic value to their customers. They
               are establishing mentoring programs for minority and women
               contractors and employing consulting firms to assist them in
               acquiring these new cultural competencies. Other firms are
               focusing their efforts on creating a working atmosphere that
               embraces a diverse workforce, complete with worker training on
               how to effectively deal with the changing workplace culture.
               What positive effects are these approaches having on the overall
               problem? Should these individual efforts to improve the image of
               construction and its thrust for diversity be aligned? This paper
               will attempt to highlight the successes that some programs have
               achieved and what new innovations they invoked in their
               endeavors. Additionally, it will address areas where the efforts

               experienced by British unions since 1979. During that period,

               successive Conservative governments have enacted labor
               legislation opposed by unions. The author views the government's
               strongly unfavorable treatment of unions as a powerful force,

               growth of temporary and part-time workers and the decline of the
               manufacturing sector, are likely to have more lasting adverse
               effects. Unions are adopting various strategies to try to
               counteract the decline of their membership, including innovative
               organizing methods and expanded services for members. The fate
               of the unions will depend, the author concludes, on the success

  abstract  = "Vocational education and training (VET) has been facing a lot of
               challenges lately in the context of geostrategic forces that are
               shaping our world. Recent technological changes, combined with
               shifts in global economic power, accelerating urbanization, and
               demographic changes have put pressure on the VET to become more
               responsive to the needs of the labour market and society.
               E-learning has been seen as an effective way of improving the
               quality of teaching and learning in VET schools due to its
               various forms. Nevertheless, there has been some disagreement in
               the litearture on the advantages and disadvantages of the use of
               of e-learning in VET. Besides, some studies recently reported a
               decline in enthusiasm about the effects of e-learning in
               companies. In order to closely examine the effects of e-learning
               in VET, we conduct a literature review. We then carry out a
               discussion of the pros and cons with the aim of developing
               suggestions for the better use of e-learning in VET. The results
               of the litearture review show that learners and providers of
               e-learning benefit from it in different ways. In order to
               minimise the risks involved in using e-learning, a mixture of
               online and face-to-face events could be used, and adjusted
               pedagogical concepts should be designed and developed explicitly

  abstract  = "AbstractManufacturing in advanced open economies has experienced
               significant disruption. Rapid technological change, outsourcing
               and off shoring have beset manufacturing resulting in a general
               and steady decline in manufacturing employment. Despite this
               turbulence, there remains a strong nostalgia for manufacturing
               resulting in frequent public policy discussion about how best to
               revitalise the industry. A popular view is that a strong
               manufacturing industry relies upon an equally strong vocational,
               education and training (VET) system to provide requisite skill
               needs. Given the dramatic pace of change in the manufacturing
               industry do such arguments still hold true? This paper considers
               this question through an examination of what the revitalisation
               of US manufacturing means for employment and skills needs and
               the extent to which US?s decentralised and largely eroded VET
               system serves as a barrier to the industry?s revitalisation.
               Drawing upon a mixed method approach that includes primary and
               secondary data collected in three US cities, the paper argues
               that the focus on needing to have a strong VET system overlooks
               the emergence of flexible micro-skill ecosystems that evolve to
               address local skill needs. These micro skill eco-systems open
               the prospects for skills and training innovations to meet
               changing workforce needs in a changing industry.",

              collaborative learning environments that adapt their
              characteristics, and sometimes provide intelligent hints and
              feedback, to improve individual students' collaborative
              interactions. ACLS often involves a system that can automatically
              assess student dialogue, model effective and ineffective
              collaboration, and provide relevant support. While there is
              evidence that ACLS can improve student learning, little is known
              about why systems that incorporate ACLS are effective. Does
              relevant support improve student interactions by providing
              just-in-time feedback, or do students who believe they are
              receiving relevant support feel more accountable for the
              collaboration, and thus more motivated to improve their
              interactions? In this paper, we describe an adaptive system we
              have developed to support help-giving during peer tutoring in
              high school algebra: the Adaptive Peer Tutoring Assistant (APTA).
              To validate our approach, we conducted a controlled study that
              demonstrated that our system provided students with more relevant
              support and was more effective at improving student learning than
              parallel nonadaptive conditions. Our contributions involve
              generalizable techniques for implementing ACLS that can function
              adaptively and effectively, and the finding that adaptive support
              does indeed improve student learning because of the relevance of
              the support.",

              ideal model, in a process calledknowledge tracing. The tutor
              presents an individualized sequence of exercises to the student
              based on these probability estimates until the student has
              `mastered' each rule. The programming tutor, cognitive model and

                 commonly undertaken in many industries. What is lacking from

                 philosophies underpinning KM and particularly for how tacit

              discernible in the ways teachers described seeking out signals

               major learning objective in the initial vocational training of
               carpenter apprentices. Carpenters specifically need to develop
               the capability to switch between two-dimensional (2D) and
               three-dimensional (3D) representations. Previous studies have
               explored spatial skills, but never in the context of vocational
               education and training (VET). This study sheds light on the
               level and evolution of spatial skills in the initial vocational
               training of carpenter apprentices in Switzerland. Methods In
               this study, 726 subjects (98 females) who were either carpenter
               apprentices, apprentices of another profession, or high school
               students, took a test on spatial skills with three parts: mental
               rotation, paper folding, and orthographic projections. The first
               two parts are widely used tests for spatial skills, while the
               last one was specifically designed to address the 2D-3D
               transition that is a core skill of carpenters. Results Carpenter
               apprentices do have higher spatial skills than would be expected
               given their general school level. In particular, their spatial
               skills were found to be similar to those of high school students
               and superior to those of apprentices of another profession.
               Carpenters' spatial skills improve over the course of their
               apprenticeship. These findings confirm that spatial skills are
               trainable and suggest that the high spatial skills level of
               carpenter apprentices is due to a selection bias as well as to
               the training that they receive during their apprenticeship.
               Conclusions Carpenter apprentices improve their spatial skills
               over the time of their initial vocational training. As spatial
               skills are crucial in this profession, there is a need to
               develop further solutions that encourage further improvement of
               teaching and learning activities for spatial skills.",

  author    = "Coenen, Johan and Heijke, Hans and Meng, Christoph",
  abstract  = "This paper compares narrow, or specialised, and broad, or less
               specialised, upper-secondary vocational education (VE)
               programmes in the Netherlands with respect to their graduates'
               position in the labour market. The data are from three cohorts
               of the Dutch VE Monitor, a survey of VE graduates 18 months
               after graduation. The programmes of the highest level---Level
               4---of the school-based learning route are investigated. To
               separate narrow from broad programmes, a novel criterion is
               used, based on the argument that the match between education and
               a job within a narrow programme's occupational domain is better
               than outside that domain and that, for a broad programme, such a
               match does not differ significantly between the programme's
               domain and outside it. This study shows that graduates from
               narrow education programmes have a less favourable labour market
               position than graduates from broad programmes. They have a
               greater chance of being unemployed and are more often mismatched
               in their jobs, both horizontally and vertically. They earn less
               in any case, particularly if their job is outside their
               occupational domain or below their level. They consequently
               experience worse career opportunities and many are more
               dissatisfied with their jobs. To solve this problem, it would be
               better to focus on realising a shift in the influx of students
               from narrow to broad education programmes instead of broadening
               all narrow programmes. Besides this shift to broader programmes,
               offering broad variants of narrow programmes while maintaining
               the narrow, specialist variants could be highly allocation
               efficient.",

               policy reforms",
  author    = "Gambin, Lynn and Hogarth, Terence",
  abstract  = "That so many employers in various sectors continue to train
               apprentices despite incurring substantial costs can be taken as
               prima facie evidence of there being ways to mitigate the
               investment risk. The main downside in the English apprenticeship
               system is that the overall levels of employer engagement and
               training volumes are considered sub-optimal and in reality there
               is a fine balance which can put the performance of the firm and
               the wider economy at risk due to insufficient skill development.
               This paper draws on data from the Net Costs and Benefits of
               Training to Employers series of studies (carried out between
               1994 and 2012). Each of the original studies consisted of case
               studies of employers in particular sectors in which the costs
               associated with training an apprentice were considered against
               the benefits employers obtain through this activity during the
               training period. Data in the original studies was collected in
               face-to-face interviews with the employers. The data were
               aligned with an accounting framework that captured the relevant
               costs and benefits of apprenticeship training from the
               perspective of the employer. Calculations were carried out to
               also indicate the payback period (i.e. the period after training
               has taken over which an employer could be expected to recoup any
               net cost they had incurred). We present the most comprehensive
               available estimates of the net costs of apprenticeship to
               employers in England to illustrate how costs vary across sectors
               and how, for most employers, engaging in apprenticeship training
               leaves them with a net cost at the end of the training period.
               The extent of this net cost at the end of the formal training
               period is found to vary substantially by sector and level of
               apprenticeship and over time, in real terms, the net costs of
               training have tended to increase across all sectors. Employers
               reported a range of rationales for training apprentices; from
               supply-led (e.g. where participation was prompted by training
               providers offering it for free) to more demand-led (e.g. where
               employers saw apprenticeship as necessary for acquiring needed
               skills) reasons. Employer sensitivity to various cost parameters
               depended upon where on the supply- to demand-led continuum they
               fell. Despite various policy changes since the mid-1990s,
               employers' engagement in apprenticeships in England has not
               achieved a significant volume and there are still financial
               risks attached to investing in this form of training. Even with
               the latest reforms of funding and delivery embodied in the move
               to apprenticeship standards and the introduction of an employer
               levy, there is no guarantee that more employers will be willing
               to train apprentices or that those who already engage will train
               more. There is a need to consider various ways of reducing
               employers' risk without inducing unintended behavioural changes
               that counter overall policy objectives.",

               identify vocational education and training across jurisdictions,
               and across historical periods. Both Rushbrook and Stevenson seek
               for vocational education and training what Rushbrook calls an
               ?abstracted institutional teleology?. Yet such a quest may
               degenerate into essentialism, and in any case is vulnerable to
               being made obsolete by the changes that vocational education and

              the Czech Republic within the last four years. The design
              consists of grooved corner posts with inserted planks. This type
              of construction reveals advanced technical know-how and, till

              solid timber construction system using CLT are (1) standards
              comprising the product, testing and design, (2) harmonized
              load-bearing models for calculating CLT properties based on the
              properties of the base material board, enabling relatively fast
              use of local timber species and qualities, and (3) the
              development of CLT adequate connection systems for economic
              assembling and an increasing degree of utilization regarding the
              load-bearing potential of CLT elements in the joints. The
              establishment of a worldwide harmonized package of standards is
              recommended as this would broaden the fields of application for
              timber engineering and strengthen CLT in competition with
              solid-mineral based building materials.",

              construction: The case of cross laminated timber",
  author   = "D'Amico, Bernardino and Pomponi, Francesco and Hart, Jim",
  abstract = "The building and construction sector is a large contributor to
              anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and consumes the vastest
              amount of natural resources. Widely considered a
              hard-to-decarbonise sector, improvements in buildings and
              construction are of fundamental importance for national and
              global targets to combat climate change. At material level,
              mitigation opportunities exist in terms of efficiency (using less
              of the same material) and substitution (using a different
              material). This article investigates the latter, with a global
              focus on the use of cross laminated timber to replace concrete
              floors in steel structural systems. This approach, whilst
              innovative, does not require any technological development nor
              upskilling of current professional practice, thus making it an
              immediately viable solution to accelerate decarbonisation. We
              combine Material Flow Analysis with Life Cycle Assessment across
              both spatial and temporal dimensions, accounting for different
              levels of uptake of the proposed hybrid construction in the next
              30 years. Results show that greenhouse gas emissions saving
              potentials range between 20 and 80 Mt CO2e (95\% confidence
              interval) with an average around 50 Mt CO2e in the case of full
              uptake of the hybrid construction system by 2050. Our analysis
              does not account for carbon sequestration potential in timber,
              which would make the savings much greater. Still, the overall
              savings represent a 1.5\% reduction of the annual greenhouse gas
              emissions generally attributed to construction, thus making it a
              non-trivial contribution to progress towards global targets of
              net-zero carbon buildings.",

  abstract    = "CONTEXT: Evidence suggests that clinicians may not be learning
                 effectively from all facets of their practice, potentially
                 because their training has not fully prepared them to do so.
                 To address this gap, we argue that there is a need to identify
                 systems of instruction and assessment that enhance clinicians'
                 'preparation for future learning'. Preparation for future
                 learning (PFL) is understood to be the capacity to learn new
                 information, to use resources effectively and innovatively,
                 and to invent new strategies for learning and problem solving
                 in practice. CURRENT STATE: Education researchers have
                 developed study designs that use dynamic assessments to
                 measure what trainees have acquired in the past, as well as
                 what they are able to learn in the present. More recently,
                 researchers have also started to emphasise and measure whether
                 and how trainees take action to gain the information they need
                 to learn. Knowing that there are study designs and emerging
                 metrics for assessing PFL, the next question is how to design
                 instruction that helps trainees develop PFL capacities.
                 Although research evidence is still accumulating, the current
                 evidence base suggests training that encourages 'productive
                 failure' through guided discovery learning (i.e. where
                 trainees solve problems and perform tasks without direct
                 instruction, though often with some form of feedback) creates
                 challenging conditions that enhance learning and equip
                 trainees with PFL-related behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: Preparation
                 for future learning and the associated capacity of being
                 adaptive as one learns in and from training and clinical
                 practice have been missed in most contemporary training and
                 assessment systems. We propose a research agenda that (i)
                 explores how real-world adaptive expert activity unfolds in
                 the health care workplace to inform the design of instruction
                 for developing PFL, (ii) identifies measures of behaviours
                 that relate to PFL, and (iii) addresses potential
                 sociocultural barriers that limit clinicians' opportunities to
                 learn from their daily practice.",

               gamification of virtual assembly planning on the user
               performance, user experience and
               engagement.Design/methodology/approach A multi-touch table was
               used to manipulate virtual parts and gamification features were
               integrated into the virtual assembly environment. An experiment
               was conducted in two conditions: a gamified and a non-gamified
               virtual environment. Subjects had to assemble a virtual pump.
               The user performance was evaluated in terms of the number of
               errors, the feasibility of the generated assembly sequence and
               the user feedback.Findings The gamification reduced the number
               of errors and increased the score representing the number of
               right decisions. The results of the subjective and objective
               analysis showed that the number of errors decreased with
               engagement in the gamified assembly. The increase in the overall
               user experience reduced the number of errors. The subjective
               evaluation showed a significant difference between the gamified
               and the non-gamified assembly in terms of the level of
               engagement, the learning usability and the overall
               experience.Research limitations/implications The effective
               learning retention after training has not been tested, and
               longitudinal studies are necessary. The effect of the used
               gamification elements has been evaluated as a whole; further
               work could isolate the most beneficial features and add other
               elements that might be more beneficial for
               learning.Originality/value The research reported in this paper
               provides valuable insights into the gamification of virtual
               assembly using a low-cost multi-touch interface. The results are
               promising for training operators to assemble a product at the
               design stage.",

  author    = "Parsons, Sarah and Cobb, Sue",
  abstract  = "Technology design in the field of human?computer interaction has
               developed a continuum of participatory research methods, closely
               mirroring methodological approaches and epistemological
               discussions in other fields. This paper positions such
               approaches as examples of inclusive research (to varying
               degrees) within education, and illustrates the complexity of
               navigating and involving different user groups in the context of
               multi-disciplinary research projects. We illustrate this
               complexity with examples from our recent work, involving
               children on the autism spectrum and their teachers. Both groups
               were involved in learner-centred design processes to develop
               technologies to support social conversation and collaboration.
               We conceptualize this complexity as a triple-decker ?sandwich?
               representing Theory, Technologies and Thoughts and argue that
               all three layers need to be appropriately aligned for a good
               quality ?product? or outcome. However, the challenge lies in
               navigating and negotiating all three layers at the same time,
               including the views and experiences of the learners. We question
               the extent to which it may be possible to combine co-operative,
               empowering approaches to participatory design with an
               outcome-focused agenda that seeks to develop a robust learning

              been driven by pragmatic concerns and also an emancipatory aim to
              give children voice and agency over decisions. However, little

              performed in the early exploratory phase of design prior to overt

              dyslexic children and the other with children with cerebral
              palsy. An analysis of children's and researchers' power dynamics

              the outcomes of this power and to reflect on how these moments
              shaped the design agenda. Our work identifies a number of

  author   = "Renwick, Kerry",
  abstract = "Literacy is increasingly being thought of as a social practice
              with its use and understandings being context dependent. As an
              essential element within and of education, literacy offers
              possibilities for engaging in everyday life. Health literacy has
              emerged as a means to develop health-promoting practices that has
              meaning in social contexts. Reflecting biomedical interests, the
              focus of health literacy is predominately constructed as a
              neutral and technical process that has specific meaning and
              practice, positioning it as functional literacy. This paper
              presents one approach to critical health literacy based on a
              multidimension (3D) approach with literacy as a situated social
              practice. The 3D model will be described and then the model's
              application to health literacy will be explored. The use of the
              3D model to build critical health literacy challenges the
              biomedical approach to health literacy as solely functional
              literacy. Functional literacy is not sufficient for a person to
              build a critical social consciousness and illuminate how social
              determinates of health create inequitable health or how it could
              be ameliorated. Social justice and equity are presented as
              fundamental prerequisites for health. Working with young people
              in context of schools, the reciprocal relationship between health
              and education offers space for possibilities around literacy
              skills and understanding about what creates health. The same
              space can enable young people to see opportunities for
              empowerment to shape and recreate their social reality. Health
              literacy for social justice and equity, therefore, has to include
              possibilities for understanding and responding to sociocultural
              knowing.",

                 Health and Medicine, University of Tasmania, Australia,
                 Hobart, TAS, Australia.",
  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Grounded theory is a well-known methodology
                 employed in many research studies. Qualitative and
                 quantitative data generation techniques can be used in a
                 grounded theory study. Grounded theory sets out to discover or
                 construct theory from data, systematically obtained and
                 analysed using comparative analysis. While grounded theory is
                 inherently flexible, it is a complex methodology. Thus, novice
                 researchers strive to understand the discourse and the
                 practical application of grounded theory concepts and
                 processes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to provide a
                 contemporary research framework suitable to inform a grounded
                 theory study. RESULT: This article provides an overview of
                 grounded theory illustrated through a graphic representation
                 of the processes and methods employed in conducting research
                 using this methodology. The framework is presented as a
                 diagrammatic representation of a research design and acts as a
                 visual guide for the novice grounded theory researcher.
                 DISCUSSION: As grounded theory is not a linear process, the
                 framework illustrates the interplay between the essential
                 grounded theory methods and iterative and comparative actions
                 involved. Each of the essential methods and processes that
                 underpin grounded theory are defined in this article.
                 CONCLUSION: Rather than an engagement in philosophical
                 discussion or a debate of the different genres that can be
                 used in grounded theory, this article illustrates how a
                 framework for a research study design can be used to guide and
                 inform the novice nurse researcher undertaking a study using
                 grounded theory. Research findings and recommendations can
                 contribute to policy or knowledge development, service
                 provision and can reform thinking to initiate change in the
                 substantive area of inquiry.",

  abstract    = "`Setting' is a widespread practice in the UK, despite little
                 evidence of its efficacy and substantial evidence of its
                 detrimental impact on those allocated to the lowest sets.
                 Taking a Bourdieusian approach, we propose that setting can be
                 understood as a practice through which the social and cultural
                 reproduction of dominant power relations is enacted within
                 schools. Drawing on survey data from 12,178 Year 7 (age 11/12)
                 students and discussion groups and individual interviews with
                 33 students, conducted as part of a wider project on secondary
                 school grouping practices, we examine the views of students
                 who experience setting, exploring the extent to which the
                 legitimacy of the practice is accepted or challenged, focusing
                 on students' negative views about setting. Analyses show that
                 privileged students (White, middle class) were most likely to
                 be in top sets whereas working‐class and Black students were
                 more likely to be in bottom sets. Students in the lowest sets
                 (and boys, Black students and those in receipt of free school
                 meals) were the most likely to express negative views of
                 setting and to question the legitimacy and `fairness' of
                 setting as a practice, whereas top‐set students defended the
                 legitimacy of setting and set allocations as `natural' and
                 `deserved'. This paper argues that setting is incompatible
                 with social justice approaches to education and calls for the
                 foregrounding of the views of those who are disadvantaged by
                 the practice as a tool for challenging the doxa of setting.",

  abstract = "Learning Analytics is an emerging research field and design
              discipline which occupies the `middle space' between the learning
              sciences/educational research, and the use of computational
              techniques to capture and analyse data (Suthers and Verbert,
              2013). We propose that the literature examining the triadic
              relationships between epistemology (the nature of knowledge),
              pedagogy (the nature of learning and teaching) and assessment
              provide critical considerations for bounding this middle space.
              We provide examples to illustrate the ways in which the
              understandings of particular analytics are informed by this
              triad. As a detailed worked example of how one might design
              analytics to scaffold a specific form of higher order learning,
              we focus on the construct of epistemic beliefs: beliefs about the
              nature of knowledge. We argue that analytics grounded in a
              pragmatic, sociocultural perspective are well placed to explore
              this construct using discourse-centric technologies. The examples
              provided throughout this paper, through emphasising the
              consideration of intentional design issues in the middle space,

                 into using 360° videos to present small segments of lecture
                 content for IT students in an Australian University. The aim
                 of this study was to understand; what is the impact of
                 incorporating 360° videos into class content for students and
                 teaching staff? In this study the 360° videos are described as
                 ``learning atoms''. Learning atoms are short duration videos
                 (1 to 5 minutes) captured in 360°. Background: Within this
                 paper we conducted experiments in the classroom using 360°
                 videos to determine if they have an impact on student's
                 feeling of presence with class content. Additionally, to
                 follow up, how does the inclusion of 360° impact on the
                 teaching experience. Methodology: The methodology used in this
                 study focused on both quantitative and qualita-tive aspects.
                 Data was captured at the same time during the teaching period
                 to address the research questions. In order to gauge the
                 feeling of presence within the classroom a short survey was
                 administered to students in the undergraduate IT class at the
                 start (pre) and end (post) of the semester using the same
                 questions to measure any change. Contribution: The main
                 contributions from this study were that we demonstrated there
                 is a potential for providing an alternative `immersive'
                 content presentation for students. This alternative content
                 took the form of 360° learning atoms, whereas further showed
                 our nuance process for creating and publishing of these atoms.
                 Findings: The results show that for students, learning atoms
                 can help improve the sense of presence, particularly for
                 remote students, however the interactive experience can take
                 student's attention away from the lecturer. The results
                 present potential for providing an alternative `immersive'
                 content presentation for students, however problems for uptake
                 are present for both students and teachers, such as image
                 capture quality and file size Impact on Society: We foresee
                 this approach as being a new approach to teaching students in
                 higher education within online spaces to increase engagement
                 and move towards having a richer virtual experience no matter
                 the location. Future Research: Future research will be
                 conducted to resolve whether presence and engagement is

              However, little is known about this new generation of mobile
              online AR games. Existing theories provide limited applicability
              for user understanding. Against this background, this research
              provides a comprehensive framework based on uses and
              gratification theory, technology risk research, and flow theory.
              The proposed framework aims to explain the drivers of attitudinal
              and intentional reactions, such as continuance in gaming or
              willingness to invest money in in-app purchases. A survey among
              642 Pok{\'e}mon Go players provides insights into the
              psychological drivers of mobile AR games. The results show that
              hedonic, emotional, and social benefits and social norms drive
              consumer reactions while physical risks (but not data privacy
              risks) hinder consumer reactions. However, the importance of
              these drivers differs depending on the form of user behavior.",

              projects do not readily add tangible intrinsic value to the

              monitoring the implementation of every single part of buildings
              and reflecting them on the BIM models can become highly labour
              intensive and error-prone, due to the vast amount of data
              produced in the form of schedules, reports and photo logs. In
              order to address the mentioned methodological and technical gap,
              this paper presents a framework and a proof of concept prototype
              for on-demand automated simulation of construction projects,
              integrating some cutting edge IT solutions, namely image
              processing, machine learning, BIM and Virtual Reality. This study
              utilised the Unity game engine to integrate data from the
              original BIM models and the as-built images, which were processed
              via various computer vision techniques. These methods include
              object recognition and semantic segmentation for identifying
              different structural elements through supervised training in
              order to superimpose the real world images on the as-planned

              framework empowers project managers and stockholders with an
              advanced decision-making tool, highlighting the inconsistencies

              Virtual Reality for Education and Training Purpose",
  author   = "Mastli, Majid and Zhang, Jiansong",
  abstract = "In a construction project, cranes are usually involved in the
              mobilization of materials and equipment. Therefore, a
              well-planned crane movement on a construction job site increases
              the efficiency of construction operations. This is especially the
              case when a crane is being operated from the material storage
              place to the workspace in a highway construction project, because
              the time allowed for such movement is typically tight, as
              constrained by the vehicular traffic on the highway. To explore
              the use of construction simulation in facilitating people?s
              understanding of construction processes, this paper presents a
              crane movement simulation from the site storage location to the
              beam erection location in a highway construction project on the
              Interstate 94. This simulation was modeled in the Unity 3D game
              engine and visualized in a CAVE virtual reality environment. CAVE
              is an immersive virtual reality environment where projections
              according to different view angles of a scene are projected onto
              different walls of a space. The purpose of this simulation is to
              help people plan crane routes during the construction planning
              phase. The objectives of planning the crane routes are minimizing
              crane trip length and trip time so as to minimize interruptions
              to the highway traffic, save construction costs, and achieve more
              sustainable construction operations. The simulation was tried by
              72 volunteers. A survey of these volunteers showed that 95\% of
              them understood crane operations after trying the simulation,
              compared to 35\% before trying the simulation, and 80\% of the
              responses agreed that such simulation helps people conduct
              construction planning.",

               In this paper, we test the efficacy of natural language tutoring
               to teach and scaffold acquisition of these skills. We describe
               ProPL (Pro-PELL), a dialogue-based intelligent tutoring system

  abstract  = "Purpose Apprenticeship programmes are designed to provide young
               trainees with essential broad-based skills. Through
               apprenticeships, different sectors that are underpopulated can
               fill up their skills gaps. Apprenticeships are particularly
               useful to the construction sector which has a high ageing
               workforce and associated lower labour productivity. However, the
               completion rates of apprenticeship training programmes in the
               construction sector remain low in several countries across the
               globe. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to review the
               published research on apprenticeship training that is
               specifically focused on the construction sector, to determine
               the current status quo and suggest a direction for future
               research.Design/methodology/approach A systematic review
               approach was adopted. Based on a comprehensive search using
               SCOPUS databases, 33 relevant journal articles were identified
               and analysed.Findings It was found that monitoring and control
               is the most mentioned factor responsible for improvements in the
               completion rates of apprenticeship training. In contrast, the
               length of time required for going through the full training is
               the most common factor responsible for low completion rates.
               Three research gaps were identified, among which is the dearth
               of studies that has focused on apprentices training in
               developing countries.Research limitations/implications The gaps
               identified in the current knowledge on apprenticeship training
               would serve as a justification for future investigations.
               However, the scope of the review is limited to papers published
               in academic journals and citable through SCOPUS.Practical
               implications The outcomes of the study provide researchers and
               other relevant stakeholders with a concise report on the
               findings of previous studies. It also provides insight into
               strategies for improving the completion rates of apprenticeship
               training in the construction sector.Originality/value A
               systematic evaluation of the extant literature draws on
               theoretical evidence and highlights the factors that are more
               likely to influence the outcomes of apprentice training for

  abstract = "In large-scale assessments such as the ones encountered in MOOCs,
              a lot of usage data is available because of the number of
              learners involved. Newcomers, that just arrive on a MOOC, have
              various backgrounds in terms of knowledge, but the platform
              hardly knows anything about them. Therefore, it is crucial to
              elicit their knowledge fast, in order to personalize their
              learning experience. Such a problem has been called learner
              cold-start. We present in this article an algorithm for sampling
              a group of initial, diverse questions for a newcomer, based on a
              method recently used in machine learning: determinantal point
              processes. We show, using real data, that our method outperforms
              existing techniques such as uncertainty sampling, and can provide
              useful feedback to the learner over their strong and weak points.",

  abstract  = "It is only in the last century, and only in industrialized
               nations, that formal schooling has emerged as a widespread
               method of educating the young. Before schools, apprenticeship
               was the most common means of learning, used to transmit the
               knowledge required for expert practice in fields from painting
               and sculpting to medicine and law. Even today, many complex and
               important skills, such as those required for language use and
               social interaction, are learned informally through
               apprenticeshiplike methods--i.e., methods involving not didactic
               teaching, but observation, coaching, and successive
               approximation while carrying out a variety of tasks and
               activities. The differences between formal schooling and
               apprenticeship methods are many, but for our purposes, one is
               most important. Perhaps as a by-product of the specialization of
               learning in schools, skills and knowledge taught in schools have
               become abstracted from their uses in the world. In
               apprenticeship learning, on the other hand, target skills are
               not only continually in use by skilled practitioners, but are
               instrumental to the accomplishment of meaningful tasks. Said
               differently, apprenticeship embeds the learning of skills and
               knowledge in the social and functional context of their use.
               This difference is not academic, but has serious implications
               for the nature of the knowledge that students acquire. This
               paper attempts to elucidate some of those implications through a
               proposal for the retooling of apprenticeship methods for the
               teaching and learning of cognitive skills. Specifically, we
               propose the development of a new cognitive apprenticeship to
               teach students the thinking and problem-solving skills involved
               in school subjects such as reading, writing, and mathematics.
               The organization of the paper is as follows: In the first
               section, we discuss briefly what we believe to be key
               shortcomings in current curricular and pedagogical practices. We
               then present some of the structural features of traditional
               apprenticeship and discuss, in general, what would be required
               to adapt these characteristics to the teaching and learning of
               cognitive skills. In the second section we consider in detail
               three recently developed pedagogical ``success models,'' which
               we believe exemplify aspects of apprenticeship methods in
               teaching the thinking and reasoning skills involved in reading,
               writing and mathematics. We attempt to show how and why these
               methods are successful with regard to the development of not
               only the cognitive, but also the metacognitive, skills requited
               for true expertise. In the final section, we organize our ideas
               on the purposes and characteristics of successful teaching into
               a general framework for the design of learning environments,
               where ``environment'' includes the content being taught, the
               pedagogical methods employed, the sequencing of learning
               activities, and the sociology of learning. This framework
               emphasizes how cognitive apprenticeship goes beyond the
               techniques of traditional apprenticeship. We hope it will be
               useful to the field in designing, evaluating, and doing research
               on pedagogical methods, materials, and technologies.",

              have emerged as key concepts in safety management which promise a
              move away from bureaucracy and a means to manage safety without
              sacrificing performance. However, attempts to apply these ideas
              outside the ultra-safe sectors within which they developed have
              so far been limited. This paper uses the construction industry as
              a test case to explore the applicability of HRO and RE in a less
              highly regulated context. Through this discussion the research
              gaps are highlighted which have prevented the expansion of these
              new approaches into new sectors. The project-based nature,
              transient workforce, widespread outsourcing of labour and
              financial pressure of the construction sector limit opportunities
              for investment in employees and learning from experience; hence,
              developing principles advocated by HRO and RE such as management
              commitment, sensitivity to the frontline, prioritisation of
              safety, empowerment of employees, and a just culture presents a
              significant challenge. In spite of these barriers, there are also
              opportunities to be considered for construction to incorporate
              aspects of HRO and RE at an employee-centred level rather than
              organisational: Aspects of mindfulness and imagination; RE's
              progressive understanding of accidents; and its holistic approach
              to cultivating resilience. It is argued that these opportunities
              offer a useful perspective for reframing safety debates in
              construction. The paper concludes with a research agenda which
              puts forward the need to extend and adapt aspects of HRO and RE
              in order to tackle some of the key characteristics of
              construction, namely subcontractor networks and temporary

                 in many species. However, auditory maps of space have not been
                 reported in the primate brain. Instead, recent studies have
                 suggested that sound location may be encoded via broadly
                 responsive neurons whose firing rates vary roughly
                 proportionately with sound azimuth. Within frontal space, maps
                 and such rate codes involve different response patterns at the
                 level of individual neurons. Maps consist of neurons
                 exhibiting circumscribed receptive fields, whereas rate codes
                 involve open-ended response patterns that peak in the
                 periphery. This coding format discrepancy therefore poses a
                 potential problem for brain regions responsible for
                 representing both visual and auditory information. Here, we
                 investigated the coding of auditory space in the primate
                 superior colliculus(SC), a structure known to contain visual
                 and oculomotor maps for guiding saccades. We report that, for
                 visual stimuli, neurons showed circumscribed receptive fields
                 consistent with a map, but for auditory stimuli, they had
                 open-ended response patterns consistent with a rate or
                 level-of-activity code for location. The discrepant response
                 patterns were not segregated into different neural populations
                 but occurred in the same neurons. We show that a read-out
                 algorithm in which the site and level of SC activity both
                 contribute to the computation of stimulus location is
                 successful at evaluating the discrepant visual and auditory
                 codes, and can account for subtle but systematic differences
                 in the accuracy of auditory compared to visual saccades. This
                 suggests that a given population of neurons can use different
                 codes to support appropriate multimodal behavior.",

  abstract    = "Rivalry is a common tool to probe visual awareness: a constant
                 physical stimulus evokes multiple, distinct perceptual
                 interpretations (``percepts'') that alternate over time.
                 Percepts are typically described as mutually exclusive,
                 suggesting that a discrete (all-or-none) process underlies
                 changes in visual awareness. Here we follow two strategies to
                 address whether rivalry is an all-or-none process: first, we
                 introduce two reflexes as objective measures of rivalry, pupil
                 dilation and optokinetic nystagmus (OKN); second, we use a
                 continuous input device (analog joystick) to allow observers a
                 gradual subjective report. We find that the ``reflexes''
                 reflect the percept rather than the physical stimulus. Both
                 reflexes show a gradual dependence on the time relative to
                 perceptual transitions. Similarly, observers' joystick
                 deflections, which are highly correlated with the reflex
                 measures, indicate gradual transitions. Physically simulating
                 wave-like transitions between percepts suggest piece-meal
                 rivalry (i.e., different regions of space belonging to
                 distinct percepts) as one possible explanation for the gradual
                 transitions. Furthermore, the reflexes show that dominance
                 durations depend on whether or not the percept is actively
                 reported. In addition, reflexes respond to transitions with
                 shorter latencies than the subjective report and show an
                 abundance of short dominance durations. This failure to report
                 fast changes in dominance may result from limited access of
                 introspection to rivalry dynamics. In sum, reflexes reveal
                 that rivalry is a gradual process, rivalry's dynamics is
                 modulated by the required action (response mode), and that
                 rapid transitions in perceptual dominance can slip away from
                 awareness.",

              medicine and the empirical evidence available. This theory
              describes expertise development as the progression through a
              series of consecutive phases, each of which is characterized by
              functionally different knowledge structures underlying
              performance. The first phase is characterized by the accumulation
              of causal knowledge about disease and its consequences. Through
              experience with real cases, this knowledge transforms into
              narrative structures called illness scripts. The cognitive
              mechanisms responsible for this transition are: Encapsulation of
              elaborated knowledge into high level but simplified causal models
              or even diagnostic categories and tuning through the inclusion of
              contextual information. The third phase is characterized by the
              use of episodic memories of actual patients in the diagnosis of
              new cases. It is assumed that knowledge acquired in different
              phases form layers in memory through a sedimentation process.
              These knowledge sediments, although usually not applied any more
              in subsequent phases in the development of expertise, remain
              available for use when ontologically more recently acquired
              structures fail to produce an adequate representation of a

  abstract  = "This paper addresses the role of the research question in social
               research. It outlines what is taken to be the conventional view
               in many methodological discussions, namely, that research
               questions guide decisions about research design and research
               methods. This position is taken to imply that social researchers
               typically take the view that research methods need to be
               tailored to the research questions that guide an investigation.
               The paper questions how far this position pertains to actual
               research practice. Drawing on interviews with researchers about
               their practices in relation to mixed?method research, two
               discourses were found in the transcripts. A particularistic
               discourse that reflects the traditional view, whereby
               mixed?method research is viewed as only appropriate when
               research questions warrant it, was uncovered. In addition, a
               universalistic discourse, which sees mixed?method research as
               more generally superior, was also uncovered. The implications of
               these viewpoints for understanding the role of research
               questions are then discussed.",

  title       = "Grounded cognition: past, present, and future",
  author      = "Barsalou, Lawrence W",
  affiliation = "Department of Psychology, Emory University.",
  abstract    = "Thirty years ago, grounded cognition had roots in philosophy,
                 perception, cognitive linguistics, psycholinguistics,
                 cognitive psychology, and cognitive neuropsychology. During
                 the next 20 years, grounded cognition continued developing in
                 these areas, and it also took new forms in robotics, cognitive
                 ecology, cognitive neuroscience, and developmental psychology.
                 In the past 10 years, research on grounded cognition has grown
                 rapidly, especially in cognitive neuroscience, social
                 neuroscience, cognitive psychology, social psychology, and
                 developmental psychology. Currently, grounded cognition
                 appears to be achieving increased acceptance throughout
                 cognitive science, shifting from relatively minor status to
                 increasing importance. Nevertheless, researchers wonder
                 whether grounded mechanisms lie at the heart of the cognitive
                 system or are peripheral to classic symbolic mechanisms.
                 Although grounded cognition is currently dominated by
                 demonstration experiments in the absence of well-developed
                 theories, the area is likely to become increasingly theory
                 driven over the next 30 years. Another likely development is
                 the increased incorporation of grounding mechanisms into
                 cognitive architectures and into accounts of classic cognitive
                 phenomena. As this incorporation occurs, much functionality of
                 these architectures and phenomena is likely to remain, along
                 with many original mechanisms. Future theories of grounded
                 cognition are likely to be heavily influenced by both
                 cognitive neuroscience and social neuroscience, and also by
                 developmental science and robotics. Aspects from the three
                 major perspectives in cognitive science-classic symbolic
                 architectures, statistical/dynamical systems, and grounded
                 cognition-will probably be integrated increasingly in future
                 theories, each capturing indispensable aspects of

  author      = "Saunders, Mirko and Quaiser-Pohl, Claudia M",
  affiliation = "University of Koblenz-Landau, Germany.",
  abstract    = "Many studies deal with solution strategies in mental-rotation
                 tests. The approaches range from global analysis, attention to
                 object parts, holistic and piecemeal strategy to a combined
                 strategy. Other studies do not speak of strategies, but of
                 holistic or piecemeal processes or even of holistic or
                 piecemeal rotation. The methodological approach used here is
                 to identify mental-rotation strategies via gaze patterns
                 derived from eye-tracking data when solving chronometric
                 mental-rotation tasks with gender-stereotyped objects. The
                 mental-rotation test consists of 3 male-stereotyped objects
                 (locomotive, hammer, wrench) and 3 femalestereotyped objects
                 (pram, hand mirror, brush) rotated at eight different angles.
                 The sample consisted of 16 women and 10 men (age: M=21.58;
                 SD=4.21). The results of a qualitative analysis with two
                 individual objects (wrench and brush) showed four different
                 gaze patterns. These gaze patterns appeared with different
                 frequency in the two objects and correlated differently with
                 performance and response time. The results indicate either an
                 objectoriented or an egocentric mental-rotation strategy
                 behind the gaze patterns. In general, a new methodological
                 approach has been developed to identify mental-rotation
                 strategies bottom-up which can also be used for other stimulus

  abstract  = "This paper is to investigate how employees' tacit knowledge
               sharing behavior is influenced by various antecedents. We
               propose that tacit knowledge sharing consists of three specific
               behaviors (i.e., socialization, externalization, and
               internalization) and they are influenced by four antecedents
               (trust, self-efficacy, knowledge tacitness, and IT support). A
               survey was conducted to collect data from 258 knowledge workers
               who worked on complex product development projects. Structural
               equation modeling was used to analyze the data. The results
               demonstrate that trust, self-efficacy, knowledge tacitness, and
               IT support significantly affect the externalization and
               internalization behaviors, and trust and IT support
               significantly affect the socialization behavior. This study is
               helpful to organizations where it is critical for employees to
               share tacit knowledge. It suggests that tacit knowledge is
               difficult to share and organizations should nurture mutual trust
               between employees, enhance their self-efficacy, and provide
               sufficient IT support so that they are more likely to engage in
               tacit knowledge sharing.",

               predicted navigational efficiency when participants were
               unexpectedly tasked to return to the origin of the route.
               Individual differences also related to aspects of user

                 of direction in the development of training tools in medical
                 education. We carried out a panel discussion at the Center for
                 Behavior Change 3rd Annual Conference, prompted by the study,
                 ``The Responses of Medical General Practitioners to
                 Unreasonable Patient Demand for Antibiotics--A Study of
                 Medical Ethics Using Immersive Virtual Reality'' (1). METHODS:
                 In Pan et al.'s study, 21 general practitioners (GPs) and GP
                 trainees took part in a videoed, 15-min virtual reality
                 scenario involving unnecessary patient demands for
                 antibiotics. This paper was discussed in-depth at the Center
                 for Behavior Change 3rd Annual Conference; the content of this
                 paper is a culmination of findings and feedback from the panel
                 discussion. The experts involved have backgrounds in virtual
                 reality, general practice, medicines management, medical
                 education and training, ethics, and philosophy. VIEWPOINT:
                 Virtual reality is an unexplored methodology to instigate
                 positive behavioral change among clinicians where other
                 methods have been unsuccessful, such as antimicrobial
                 stewardship. There are several arguments in favor of use of
                 virtual reality in medical education: it can be used for
                 ``difficult to simulate'' scenarios and to standardize a
                 scenario, for example, for use in exams. However, there are
                 limitations to its usefulness because of the cost implications
                 and the lack of evidence that it results in demonstrable
                 behavior change.",

                 emotional/affective aspects of learning. It is, therefore, an
                 extraordinary umbrella under which a considerable number of
                 variables that influence learning (e.g., self-efficacy,
                 volition, cognitive strategies) are studied within a
                 comprehensive and holistic approach. For that reason, SRL has
                 become one of the most important areas of research within
                 educational psychology. In this paper, six models of SRL are
                 analyzed and compared; that is, Zimmerman; Boekaerts; Winne
                 and Hadwin; Pintrich; Efklides; and Hadwin, J{\"a}rvel{\"a}
                 and Miller. First, each model is explored in detail in the
                 following aspects: (a) history and development, (b)
                 description of the model (including the model figures), (c)
                 empirical support, and (d) instruments constructed based on
                 the model. Then, the models are compared in a number of
                 aspects: (a) citations, (b) phases and subprocesses, (c) how
                 they conceptualize (meta)cognition, motivation and emotion,
                 (d) top-down/bottom-up, (e) automaticity, and (f) context. In
                 the discussion, the empirical evidence from the existing SRL
                 meta-analyses is examined and implications for education are
                 extracted. Further, four future lines of research are
                 proposed. The review reaches two main conclusions. First, the
                 SRL models form an integrative and coherent framework from
                 which to conduct research and on which students can be taught
                 to be more strategic and successful. Second, based on the
                 available meta-analytic evidence, there are differential
                 effects of SRL models in light of differences in students'
                 developmental stages or educational levels. Thus, scholars and
                 teachers need to start applying these differential effects of
                 the SRL models and theories to enhance students' learning and
                 SRL skills.",

  abstract    = "Abstract Background Internships are highly relevant learning
                 experiences for engineering students. However, such
                 practice-based learning settings must be carefully designed to
                 allow their learning potential to unfold. Purpose Exploring
                 the job demands-control-support (JDCS) model, this study aimed
                 to investigate how job demands, job control, and social
                 support affect interns' use of different learning strategies.
                 Method The study utilized data collected from a sample of
                 engineering students (n =?118) who completed a required
                 internship during their degree. The data were analyzed using a
                 structural equation modeling approach including latent
                 factors. Results Job demands were found to be a relevant and
                 significant driver of students' shared regulation (e.g.,
                 asking for feedback), self-regulation (e.g., self-directed use
                 of codified information), efforts to relate theory to practice
                 (e.g., connecting workplace experience with theoretical
                 knowledge), and the absence of avoidance of learning (e.g.,
                 lack of adaptation to work situations), but not of external
                 regulation (e.g., asking for help to solve problems). Job
                 control, however, was not found to be a positive or
                 significant driver of student learning. Social support was
                 found to be a relevant and significant predictor of external
                 and shared regulation but not of the other learning
                 activities. Conclusions This study provided mixed findings
                 regarding key hypotheses central to the JDCS model, generating
                 rather poor evidence supporting it. In fact, job demands, job
                 control, and social support exhibited much less explanatory
                 power than expected for engineering students' learning during
                 internships.",

               acquired through training and experience and is among the key
               factors that determine their behaviour and thus their safety.
               Yet researchers have questioned the effectiveness of
               conventional safety training. This research tested the
               hypotheses that safety training in a virtual reality (VR)

               of workers' learning and recall in identifying and assessing
               construction safety risks, than would equivalent training using
               conventional methods. Sixty-six subjects were provided training
               in construction safety and their safety knowledge was tested
               prior to the training, immediately afterward, and one month
               later. Half of the subjects received traditional classroom
               training with visual aids; the other half were trained using a
               3D immersive VR power-wall. Significant advantage was found for
               VR training for stone cladding work and for cast-in-situ
               concrete work, but not for general site safety. VR training was
               more effective in terms of maintaining trainees' attention and
               concentration. Training with VR was more effective over time,
               especially in the context of cast-in-situ concrete works. Given

               attention in recent years, the term AR was given different
               meanings by varying researchers. In this article, we first
               provide an overview of definitions, taxonomies, and technologies
               of AR. We argue that viewing AR as a concept rather than a type
               of technology would be more productive for educators,
               researchers, and designers. Then we identify certain features
               and affordances of AR systems and applications. Yet, these
               compelling features may not be unique to AR applications and can
               be found in other technological systems or learning environments
               (e.g., ubiquitous and mobile learning environments). The
               instructional approach adopted by an AR system and the alignment
               among technology design, instructional approach, and learning
               experiences may be more important. Thus, we classify three
               categories of instructional approaches that emphasize the
               ``roles,'' ``tasks,'' and ``locations,'' and discuss what and
               how different categories of AR approaches may help students
               learn. While AR offers new learning opportunities, it also
               creates new challenges for educators. We outline technological,
               pedagogical, learning issues related to the implementation of AR
               in education. For example, students in AR environments may be
               cognitively overloaded by the large amount of information they
               encounter, the multiple technological devices they are required
               to use, and the complex tasks they have to complete. This
               article provides possible solutions for some of the challenges
               and suggests topics and issues for future research.",

               by providing rich interaction in an environment similar to the
               real world. User engagement duration is known to increase in
               environments with intense interaction. However, information in
               the literature about whether gender, experience, or spatial
               ability affects interaction in these environments is limited. In
               this study, these three factors are compared to users' depth of
               interaction in a 3D virtual world. In addition, the
               relationships between engagement duration, spatial ability, and

               users' depth of interaction was not influenced by gender, but
               experience and spatial ability did affect interaction. A strong
               relationship was determined between depth of interaction and
               engagement duration, and a moderate relationship was found
               between depth of interaction and spatial ability. Findings
               indicated that when designing 3D environments, it is important
               to consider which kinds of tasks provide more interaction and to
               what extent spatial abilities affect interaction, as well as to

  author   = "Pylyshyn, Zenon W",
  abstract = "Argues that the main point of disagreement in the debate over the
              nature of mental imagery concerns the following: (a) whether
              certain aspects of the way in which images are transformed should
              be attributed to intrinsic knowledge-independent properties of
              the medium in which images are instantiated or the mechanisms by
              which they are processed; or (b) whether images are typically
              transformed in certain ways because Ss take their task to be the
              simulation of the act of witnessing certain real events taking
              place and therefore use their tacit knowledge of the imaged
              situation to cause the transformation to proceed as they believe
              it would have proceeded in reality. The tacit knowledge account
              is seen as more plausible because empirical results demonstrate
              that both ``mental scanning'' and ``mental rotation''
              transformations can be critically influenced by varying the

  abstract    = "Although the study of visual perception has made more progress
                 in the past 40 years than any other area of cognitive science,
                 there remain major disagreements as to how closely vision is
                 tied to cognition. This target article sets out some of the
                 arguments for both sides (arguments from computer vision,
                 neuroscience, psychophysics, perceptual learning, and other
                 areas of vision science) and defends the position that an
                 important part of visual perception, corresponding to what
                 some people have called early vision, is prohibited from
                 accessing relevant expectations, knowledge, and utilities in
                 determining the function it computes--in other words, it is
                 cognitively impenetrable. That part of vision is complex and
                 involves top-down interactions that are internal to the early
                 vision system. Its function is to provide a structured
                 representation of the 3-D surfaces of objects sufficient to
                 serve as an index into memory, with somewhat different outputs
                 being made available to other systems such as those dealing
                 with motor control. The paper also addresses certain
                 conceptual and methodological issues raised by this claim,
                 such as whether signal detection theory and event-related
                 potentials can be used to assess cognitive penetration of
                 vision. A distinction is made among several stages in visual
                 processing, including, in addition to the inflexible
                 early-vision stage, a pre-perceptual attention-allocation
                 stage and a post-perceptual evaluation, selection, and
                 inference stage, which accesses long-term memory. These two
                 stages provide the primary ways in which cognition can affect
                 the outcome of visual perception. The paper discusses
                 arguments from computer vision and psychology showing that
                 vision is ``intelligent'' and involves elements of ``problem
                 solving.'' The cases of apparently intelligent interpretation
                 sometimes cited in support of this claim do not show cognitive
                 penetration; rather, they show that certain natural
                 constraints on interpretation, concerned primarily with
                 optical and geometrical properties of the world, have been
                 compiled into the visual system. The paper also examines a
                 number of examples where instructions and ``hints'' are
                 alleged to affect what is seen. In each case it is concluded
                 that the evidence is more readily assimilated to the view that
                 when cognitive effects are found, they have a locus outside
                 early vision, in such processes as the allocation of focal
                 attention and the identification of the stimulus.",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly used as
                 simulation technology in emergency medicine education and
                 training, in particular for training nontechnical skills.
                 Experimental studies comparing teaching and learning in VR
                 with traditional training media often demonstrate the
                 equivalence or even superiority regarding particular variables
                 of learning or training effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: In the
                 EPICSAVE (Enhanced Paramedic Vocational Training with Serious
                 Games and Virtual Environments) project, a highly immersive
                 room-scaled multi-user 3-dimensional VR simulation environment
                 was developed. In this feasibility study, we wanted to gain
                 initial insights into the training effectiveness and media use
                 factors influencing learning and training in VR. METHODS: The
                 virtual emergency scenario was anaphylaxis grade III with
                 shock, swelling of the upper and lower respiratory tract, as
                 well as skin symptoms in a 5-year-old girl (virtual patient)
                 visiting an indoor family amusement park with her grandfather
                 (virtual agent). A cross-sectional, one-group pretest and
                 posttest design was used to evaluate the training
                 effectiveness and quality of the training execution. The
                 sample included 18 active emergency physicians. RESULTS: The
                 18 participants rated the VR simulation training positive in
                 terms of training effectiveness and quality of the training
                 execution. A strong, significant correlation (r=.53, P=.01)
                 between experiencing presence and assessing training
                 effectiveness was observed. Perceived limitations in usability
                 and a relatively high extraneous cognitive load reduced this
                 positive effect. CONCLUSIONS: The training within the virtual
                 simulation environment was rated as an effective educational
                 approach. Specific media use factors appear to modulate
                 training effectiveness (ie, improvement through ``experience
                 of presence'' or reduction through perceived limitations in
                 usability). These factors should be specific targets in the
                 further development of this VR simulation training.",

               often as a complementary approach for active, personalized

               advantage of how trainees can potentially manipulate and
               interact with virtual objects. In addition, little construction
               safety research has focused on generating and analyzing the
               inherent data that can be collected about the trainees' actions
               in the virtual environment. The objective analysis of their
               performance in the virtual environment offers precise feedback

  abstract  = "Purpose-- Using Michel Foucault's notion of heterotopia as a
               guide, the purpose of this paper is to explore the implications
               of considering the library as place, and specifically as a place
               that has the ``curious property of being in relation with all
               the other sites, but in such a way as to suspect, neutralize, or
               invent the set of relations that they happen to designate,
               mirror, or reflect'' (Foucault, 1986a, p.
               24).Design/methodology/approach-- The paper draws upon a range
               of literary examples and from biographical accounts of authors
               such as Alan Bennett, Michel Foucault, and Umberto Eco to show
               how the library space operates as a heterotopia.Findings-- The
               paper finds that drawing together the constructs of heterotopia
               and serendipity can enrich the understanding of how libraries
               are experienced as sites of play, creativity, and
               adventure.Originality/value-- Foucault's concept of heterotopia
               is offered as an original and useful frame that can account for
               the range of experiences and associations uniquely attached to
               the library.",

                 non-inferior parallel group randomized controlled trial. The
                 study was linked to a regular teaching program conducted in
                 August and September 2019. All students participated in a
                 15-min ABCDE introduction session, before they self-practiced
                 the ABCDE approach for 20 min in either a fully immersive and

                 haptic feedback (Individual VR) or with blood pressure gauge,
                 ear-thermometer and oximeter (Individual TP). The primary
                 outcome was the number of students who documented all the
                 eight predefined observations in the ABCDE approach in the
                 correct order in a practical test on an advanced simulator
                 manikin with a time limit of 5 min, done immediately after the
                 self-practice. The predefined one-sided non-inferiority limit
                 was 13\% points. RESULTS: Of all eligible students, 84\%
                 participated in the study and randomly allocated to VR (n =
                 149) or TP (n = 140). The primary outcome showed
                 non-inferiority of the VR application with 24.8\% in
                 individual VR doing all observations in correct order compared

                 CI 2.3 to 10.8). The secondary outcomes were similar between
                 the groups, but more students in VR reported liking the way
                 they practiced (absolute difference 46\% points, 95\% CI 36.5

  title     = "Assessing knowledge retention of an immersive serious game vs. A
               traditional education method in aviation safety",
  author    = "Chittaro, Luca and Buttussi, Fabio",
  abstract  = "Thanks to the increasing availability of consumer head-mounted
               displays, educational applications of immersive VR could now
               reach to the general public, especially if they include gaming
               elements (immersive serious games). Safety education of citizens
               could be a particularly promising domain for immersive serious
               games, because people tend not to pay attention to and benefit
               from current safety materials. In this paper, we propose an
               HMD-based immersive game for educating passengers about aviation
               safety that allows players to experience a serious aircraft
               emergency with the goal of surviving it. We compare the proposed
               approach to a traditional aviation safety education method (the
               safety card) used by airlines. Unlike most studies of VR for
               safety knowledge acquisition, we do not focus only on assessing
               learning immediately after the experience but we extend our
               attention to knowledge retention over a longer time span. This
               is a fundamental requirement, because people need to retain
               safety procedures in order to apply them when faced with danger.
               A knowledge test administered before, immediately after and one
               week after the experimental condition showed that the immersive
               serious game was superior to the safety card. Moreover,
               subjective as well as physiological measurements employed in the
               study showed that the immersive serious game was more engaging
               and fear-arousing than the safety card, a factor that can
               contribute to explain the obtained superior retention, as we
               discuss in the paper.",

               as well as the impact of selected instructional design
               principles in the context of virtual reality technology-based
               instruction (i.e. games, simulation, virtual worlds) in K-12 or
               higher education settings. A total of 13 studies (N = 3081) in
               the category of games, 29 studies (N = 2553) in the category of
               games, and 27 studies (N = 2798) in the category of virtual
               worlds were meta-analyzed. The key inclusion criteria were that
               the study came from K-12 or higher education settings, used
               experimental or quasi-experimental research designs, and used a
               learning outcome measure to evaluate the effects of the virtual
               reality-based instruction.Results suggest games (FEM = 0.77; REM
               = 0.51), simulations (FEM = 0.38; REM = 0.41), and virtual
               worlds (FEM = 0.36; REM = 0.41) were effective in improving
               learning outcome gains. The homogeneity analysis of the effect
               sizes was statistically significant, indicating that the studies
               were different from each other. Therefore, we conducted
               moderator analysis using 13 variables used to code the studies.
               Key findings included that: games show higher learning gains
               than simulations and virtual worlds. For simulation studies,
               elaborate explanation type feedback is more suitable for
               declarative tasks whereas knowledge of correct response is more
               appropriate for procedural tasks. Students performance is
               enhanced when they conduct the game play individually than in a
               group. In addition, we found an inverse relationship between
               number of treatment sessions learning gains for games.With
               regards to the virtual world, we found that if students were
               repeatedly measured it deteriorates their learning outcome
               gains. We discuss results to highlight the importance of
               considering instructional design principles when designing

                 ideas about cognition: (1) interacting with tools changes the
                 way we think and perceive -- tools, when manipulated, are soon
                 absorbed into the body schema, and this absorption leads to
                 fundamental changes in the way we perceive and conceive of our
                 environments; (2) we think with our bodies not just with our
                 brains; (3) we know more by doing than by seeing -- there are
                 times when physically performing an activity is better than
                 watching someone else perform the activity, even though our
                 motor resonance system fires strongly during other person
                 observation; (4) there are times when we literallythinkwith
                 things. These four ideas have major implications for

  abstract    = "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this meta-analysis is to explore
                 the presently available, empirical findings on transfer of
                 training from virtual (VR), augmented (AR), and mixed reality
                 (MR) and determine whether such extended reality (XR)-based
                 training is as effective as traditional training methods.
                 BACKGROUND: MR, VR, and AR have already been used as training
                 tools in a variety of domains. However, the question of
                 whether or not these manipulations are effective for training
                 has not been quantitatively and conclusively answered.
                 Evidence shows that, while extended realities can often be
                 time-saving and cost-saving training mechanisms, their
                 efficacy as training tools has been debated. METHOD: The
                 current body of literature was examined and all qualifying
                 articles pertaining to transfer of training from MR, VR, and
                 AR were included in the meta-analysis. Effect sizes were
                 calculated to determine the effects that XR-based factors,
                 trainee-based factors, and task-based factors had on
                 performance measures after XR-based training. RESULTS: Results
                 showed that training in XR does not express a different
                 outcome than training in a nonsimulated, control environment.
                 It is equally effective at enhancing performance. CONCLUSION:
                 Across numerous studies in multiple fields, extended realities
                 are as effective of a training mechanism as the commonly
                 accepted methods. The value of XR then lies in providing
                 training in circumstances, which exclude traditional methods,
                 such as situations when danger or cost may make traditional
                 training impossible.",

               Multimodality is an emergent phenomenon that may influence how

  abstract = "When sharing virtual collaborative environments, operators
              exchange spatial statements that refer to the objects' positions
              in the virtual space. If operators are to understand each other,
              they need to develop a common spatial frame of reference and then
              choose a space coding to describe the objects' positions. In this
              paper, we consider how the content of a virtual environment can
              influence communication between users. We designed two studies in
              which one participant (the speaker) had to indicate the position
              of one object to another participant (the addressee). The virtual
              environment was sometimes enriched by additional (proximal and
              distal) visual cues. In study 1, we considered statements
              production. We observed that the speakers most often used the
              avatar of their partner as a spatial reference to indicate a
              localization in the virtual space (i.e., Addressee-Centered
              coding) despite it increases their mental workload. Nevertheless,
              in complex situations, they also used distal cues to speak to the
              addressees (i.e., Exocentric coding of the space). In study 2, we
              considered statements comprehension. Addressee-Centered coding
              and Exocentric coding were used by the speakers in various
              spatial configurations to indicate the object position. We
              observed that Exocentric coding is the most difficult to manage
              for the addressee. These results indicate that speakers
              implemented the principle of less collaborative effort by
              adopting a way of exchanging information based on an asymmetrical
              cognitive cost, taking into consideration each other's
              difficulties. This allows a balanced mental workload to be
              maintained between the two operators throughout the task.",

               presents a framework for construction industry training
               assessment that identifies established practices rooted in
               evaluation science and developed from a review of archival
               construction industry training literature. Inclusion criteria
               for the evaluated studies are: archival training studies focused
               on the construction industry workforce and integration of
               educational theory in training creation or implementation.
               Literature meeting these criteria are summarized and a case
               review is presented detailing assessment practices and results.
               The assessment practices are then synthesized with the
               Kirkpatrick Model to analyze how closely industry assessment
               corresponds with established training evaluation standards. The
               study culminates in a training assessment framework created by
               integrating practices described in the identified studies,
               established survey writing practices, and the Kirkpatrick Model.
               This study found that two-thirds of reviewed literature used
               surveys, questionnaires, or interviews to assess training

               as a method in educational studies and exposes evidence for the
               neglect of this method in religious education research in
               particular. It argues that historical inquiry, as a counterpart
               to other research methods, can add depth and range to our
               understanding of education, including religious education, and
               can illuminate important longer‐term, broader and philosophical
               issues. The article also argues that many historical voices have
               remained silent in the existing historiography of religious
               education because such historiography is too generalised and too
               biased towards the development of national policy and curriculum

                 methodologically and theoretically, medical education
                 researchers have been increasingly willing to challenge
                 taken-for-granted assumptions about the form, content and
                 function of medical education. In this AMEE guide we describe
                 historical, discourse and text analysis approaches that can
                 help researchers and educators question the inevitability of
                 things that are currently seen as 'natural'. Why is such
                 questioning important? By articulating our assumptions and
                 interrogating the 'naturalness' of the status quo, one can
                 then begin to ask why things are the way they are. Researchers
                 can, for example, ask whether the models of medical education
                 organization and delivery that currently seem 'natural' to
                 them have been developed in order to provide the most benefit
                 to students or patients--or whether they have, rather, been
                 developed in ways that provide power to faculty members,
                 medical schools or the medical profession as a whole. An
                 understanding of the interplay of practices and power is a
                 valuable tool for opening up the field to new possibilities
                 for better medical education. The recognition that our current
                 models, rather than being 'natural', were created in
                 particular historical contexts for any number of contingent
                 reasons leads inexorably to the possibility of change. For if
                 our current ways of doing things are not, in fact, inevitable,
                 not only can they be questioned, they can be made better; they
                 can changed in ways that are attentive to whom they benefit,
                 are congruent with our current beliefs about best practice and

  abstract  = "The `traditional' construction industry has constantly been
               challenged to improve its inherent problematic practices.
               Offsite production (OSP), under the umbrella of modern methods
               of construction (MMC), has been acknowledged as a means to help
               improve construction industry performance as well as meet new
               market demands through the provision of improved, adaptable, and
               sustainable buildings. However, the deployment of OSP systems,
               if not managed properly, may adversely affect the end result and
               be counterproductive. It is therefore imperative that the
               construction industry stakeholders learn and appreciate the
               specifics, merits, as well as the risks associated with OSP
               systems in order to achieve the desired outcomes and
               consequently improve industry performance.On-the-job-training
               (OJT) is usually sought to facilitate `experiential' learning,
               which is argued to be particularly effective where a great deal
               of independence is granted to the task performer. However, OJT
               has been criticised for being expensive, limited, and sometimes
               devoid of the actual training context. In order to address the
               problems encountered with OJT, several virtual reality (VR)
               solutions have been proposed. This paper introduces one such VR
               solution prototype, in order to provide a risk-free environment
               for learning without the `do-or-die' consequences often faced on
               real construction projects. The proffered solution provides a
               unique VR environment for practicing new working conditions
               associated with OSP practices. While the `scenes' of the VR
               environment take place on a construction site, the environment
               predominantly targets professionals, such as project managers,
               construction managers, architects, designers, suppliers and
               manufacturers, to allow multidisciplinary learning to occur, and
               hence overcome `knowledge silos' or `knowledge
               compartmentation'. The VR environment enables unforeseen
               problems often caused by professionals' decisions, faulty work,
               and health and safety issues to occur; where the implications of
               which can be evaluated in respect of time, cost and resources.
               The VR environment proposed does not aim to resolve problems
               associated with OSP per se, rather aims to allow `things to go
               wrong' and consequently allows users not only to `experience'
               the resulting implications but also to reflect on those
               implications as part of the learning process. This paper
               discusses and presents the prototype for the first development
               phase of the VR interactive training environment. While the
               prototype was tested and validated with domain experts from
               industry, the research community, and academia from different EU
               countries, the data used in developing the prototype was
               constrained to one project in the UK which may limit the

  author    = "Nadim, Wafaa and Goulding, Jack S",
  abstract  = "Abstract The UK construction industry has long been criticized
               for its poor performance, poor image and inability to attract
               and retain workers. Offsite production (OSP) under the
               overarching umbrella of modern methods of construction (MMC) was
               sought by the UK Government to ameliorate the UK construction
               industry, meet market demands and overcome manual skill
               shortages. Nevertheless, professional skills shortages are
               argued to be as acute as manual skills shortfalls. In this
               respect, industry?academia collaboration is anticipated to
               provide professional skills needed for OSP and, hence, effect
               change. This paper reports the findings from the first stage of
               an ongoing triangulated research project. In this context, a
               survey was carried out to capture the perceptions of both the UK
               construction industry and academia with respect to OSP and
               preferable means for collaboration, in an attempt to explore
               common grounds for possible collaborations. A quantitative
               approach was primarily used for data collection and analysis.
               The findings from 36 large construction organizations
               (representing a 20\% response rate) and 20 construction-related
               higher-education institutions (representing a 32\% response
               rate) suggested that although the industry considered OSP to be
               the future of the UK construction industry, there seemed to be
               uncertainty about what OSP actually entailed. Notwithstanding
               these issues, academia either did not know or refuted that OSP
               is the future of the construction industry, hence suggesting a
               lack of shared understanding between industry and academia with
               respect to skills requirements and preferred means for
               collaboration. Further research is needed to bridge the gap
               between these apparent polarized views.",

               theme is that organizational knowledge is created through a
               continuous dialogue between tacit and explicit knowledge. The
               nature of this dialogue is examined and four patterns of
               interaction involving tacit and explicit knowledge are
               identified. It is argued that while new knowledge is developed
               by individuals, organizations play a critical role in
               articulating and amplifying that knowledge. A theoretical
               framework is developed which provides an analytical perspective
               on the constituent dimensions of knowledge creation. This

                 Australia required all workers in construction to complete
                 mandatory safety awareness training before they began work on
                 site. During the implementation of this new legislation there
                 was considerable resistance from the construction sector due
                 to the mandatory nature of the training. The construction
                 industry viewed this as an unnecessary impost as they
                 considered that there was already sufficient safety training
                 delivered through individual company and site inductions. In
                 2010, we evaluated the new Construction Induction Training
                 (CIT) in the commercial construction sector in Western
                 Australia to find that since 2007 there has been an
                 unanticipated change in support for the mandatory training.
                 The 2010 study shows a shift in the values of the safety
                 culture for the commercial sector of the construction
                 industry. In 2010, the industry not only supports the
                 mandatory CIT, but is very vocal in its request to
                 re-institute the refresher courses that were withdrawn in
                 2009. Indeed, 79\% of respondents claimed there were
                 measurable benefits to their business having their employees
                 complete the CIT, while 96\% claimed the CIT assisted in
                 reducing accidents/incidents on their worksites. This 2010
                 study indicates that in this case, mandatory training has had
                 a positive effect on safety culture change and gradually
                 reduced work-related injury in the industry since 2007 to the
                 present. The paper uses data from two studies conducted in
                 2006 and 2010 to highlight the unanticipated change in
                 perception of the value of mandatory safety training in the WA

  abstract    = "Experience alters behavior by producing enduring changes in
                 the neural processes that support performance. For example,
                 performing a specific action improves the execution of that
                 action via changes in associated sensory and motor neural
                 circuitry, and experience using language improves language
                 comprehension by altering the anatomy and physiology of
                 perisylvian neocortical brain regions. Here we provide
                 evidence that specialized (sports) motor experience enhances
                 action-related language understanding by recruitment of left
                 dorsal lateral premotor cortex, a region normally devoted to
                 higher-level action selection and implementation-even when
                 there is no intention to perform a real action. Experience
                 playing and watching sports has enduring effects on language
                 understanding by changing the neural networks that subserve
                 comprehension to incorporate areas active in performing sports
                 skills. Without such experience, sport novices recruit
                 lower-level sensory-motor regions, thought to support the
                 instantiation of movement, during language processing, and
                 activity in primary motor areas does not help comprehension.
                 Thus, the language system is sufficiently plastic and dynamic
                 to encompass expertise-related neural recruitment outside core
                 language networks.",

               industries have been evolving from traditional practices into
               more current, interdisciplinary and technology integrated
               methods. Complex and intricate digital technologies and mobile
               computing such as simulation, computational design and immersive
               technologies, have been exploited for different purposes such as
               reducing cost and time, improving design and enhancing overall
               project efficiency. Immersive technologies and augmented reality
               (AR), in particular, have proven to be extremely beneficial in
               this field. However, the application and usage of these
               technologies and devices in higher education teaching and
               learning environments are yet to be fully explored and still
               scarce. More importantly, there is still a significant gap in
               developing pedagogies and teaching methods that embrace the
               usage of such technologies in the AC curricula. This study,
               therefore, aims to critically analyse the current
               state-of-the-art and present the developed and improved AR
               approaches in teaching and learning methods of AC, addressing
               the identified gap in the extant literature, while developing
               transformational frameworks to link the gaps to their future
               research agenda. The conducted analysis incorporates the
               critical role of the AR implications on the AC students'
               skillsets, pedagogical philosophies in AC curricula,
               techno-educational aspects and content domains in the design and
               implementation of AR environments for AC learning. The outcomes
               of this comprehensive study prepare trainers, instructors, and

@ARTICLE{Collins1991-es,
  title    = "Cognitive Apprenticeship: Making Thinking Visible",
  author   = "Collins, A and Brown, J and Holum, A",
  abstract = "IN ANCIENT times, teaching and learning were accomplished through
              apprenticeship: We taught our children how to speak, grow crops,
              craft cabinets, or tailor clothes by showing them how and by
              helping them do it. Apprenticeship was the vehicle for
              transmitting the knowledge required for expert practice in fields
              from painting and sculpting to medicine and law. It was the
              natural way to learn. In modern times, apprenticeship has largely
              been replaced by formal schooling, except in children's learning
              of language, in some aspects of graduate education, and in
              on-the-job training. We propose an alternative model of
              instruction that is accessible within the framework of the
              typical American classroom. It is a model of instruction that
              goes back to apprenticeship but incorporates elements of
              schooling. We call this model ``cognitive apprenticeship'' While
              there are many differences between schooling and apprenticeship
              methods, we will focus on one. In apprenticeship, learners can
              see the processes of work: They watch a parent sow, plant, and
              harvest crops and help as they are able; they assist a tradesman
              as he crafts a cabinet; they piece together garments under the
              supervision of a more experienced tailor. Apprenticeship involves
              learning a physical, tangible activity. But in schooling, the
              ``practice'' of problem solving, reading comprehension, and
              writing is not at all obvious-it is not necessarily observable to
              the student. In apprenticeship, the processes of the activity are
              visible. In schooling, the processes of thinking are often
              invisible to both the students and the teacher. Cognitive
              apprenticeship is a model of instruction that works to make
              thinking visible. In this article, we will present some of the
              features of traditional apprenticeship and discuss the ways it
              can be adapted to the teaching and learning of cognitive skills.
              Then we will present three successful examples-cases in which
              teachers and researchers have used apprenticeship methods to
              teach reading, writing, and mathematics. In the final section, we
              organize our ideas about the characteristics of successful
              teaching into a general framework for the design of learning
              environments, where ``environment'' includes the content taught,
              the pedagogical methods employed, the sequencing of learning
              activities, and the sociology of learning. Although schools have
              been relatively successful in organizing and conveying large
              bodies of conceptual and factual knowledge, standard pedagogical
              practices render key aspects of expertise invisible to students.
              Too little attention is paid to the reasoning and strategies that
              experts employ when they acquire knowledge or …",

  abstract = "As a way to capture a broadly acceptable high-level
              characterization of design, we focus on the guiding values or
              ideals of the discipline. We first reason from the notion of
              engineering interfaces for usability and utility up to the 1990s
              to the current ideal of designing interfaces for experience and
              meaning. Next, we identify three recent technical and societal
              developments that are challenging the existing ideals of
              interaction design, namely the move towards hybrid
              physical/digital materials, the emergence of an increasingly
              complex and fluid digital ecology, and the increasing proportion
              of autonomous or partially autonomous systems changing their
              behavior over time and with use. These challenges in turn
              motivate us to propose three directions in which new ideals for
              interaction design might be sought: the first is to go beyond the
              language-body divide that implicitly frames most of our current
              understandings of experience and meaning, the second is to extend
              the scope of interaction design from individual interfaces to the
              complex sociotechnical fabric of human and nonhuman actors, and
              the third is to go beyond predictability by learning to design
              with machine learning.",

  abstract  = "Having a significant economic impact in country's GDP and being
               a major workforce, construction industry is yet characterized by
               low production rate, low technological advancement, minimum
               automation and robotic usage, and so on. With the visionary idea
               of Industry 4.0 that focuses on digitization of the value chain
               of a product and improving productivity through a variety of
               technologies and automated manufacturing environment, this
               research aims to develop a framework to adopt Construction 4.0
               within a construction company. Current state of the art of the
               technologies in construction associated with the notion of
               Industry 4.0 (e.g., Building Information Modelling, virtual
               reality, augmented reality, Drone, etc.) is explored through
               extensive literature studies. The proposed framework
               incorporates current technological advancement related to
               construction industry, legislative requirements, barriers,
               enterprise transformation requirements and so on. Construction
               4.0 would make a great impact in construction industry through
               improved value chain of construction projects, productivity
               improvement, and safe and sustainable construction. Indeed, the
               proposed framework would contribute to the advancement of new
               knowledge in the worlds' construction companies and provide
               potentials of new research focuses.",

  author    = "Brucker Juricic, Belinda and Galic, Mario and Marenjak, Sasa",
  abstract  = "This paper reviews the recent literature on skill and labour
               shortages in the labour market with special emphasis on the
               construction sector in the European Union Member States,
               foreseeing the Construction 4.0 era. The free movement of people
               is one of the rights of all citizens of the EU which also
               includes the free movement of workers. Labour shortages in the
               EU are expected to increase in the future due to a declining
               population and an ageing workforce. In order to recognize and
               forecast labour shortages, EU Member states use a variety of
               instruments but they do not answer as to whether it is possible
               to use migrant labour to appease those shortages. There are
               several systems used to classify labour shortages in the EU
               Member states. Most of the countries classify labour shortages
               in relation to different sectors or occupation groups as well as
               by skill levels, but in some Member States, classification is
               made according to the type of employment. Instruments used to
               measure labour shortages significantly differ from country to
               country. Several criteria are used for creating lists of
               shortage occupations and most of the criteria include demand
               side and supply side criteria. A majority of the Member States
               are facing labour and skill shortages in various sectors and the
               construction sector is not an exception. As total employment in
               the construction sector decreased, so did the share of employed
               migrants. Labour shortages in the construction sector can be
               eased by the availability of a labour supply willing to accept
               unqualified and low-paying jobs. The construction sector seeks
               low-, medium-, and high-skilled individuals and is most likely
               the sector where most of the incoming migrants will be working,
               which has an impact on the development and implementation
               dynamic of Construction 4.0.",

              terms of improvements in productivity and quality, this concept

  abstract  = "ABSTRACTThe UK is set to become Europe?s largest construction
               market by 2030. However, UK construction productivity
               performance is regarded as weak, with low skills levels
               considered to be a key contributory factor. Consequently,
               off-site construction has been identified by the UK Government
               as a vehicle for improving productivity levels if the skills
               deficiencies in this particular market segment can be addressed.
               A series of projects were, therefore, launched by the UK
               Commission for Employment and Skills (UKCES) to encourage an
               R\&D approach to skills and development application in the
               workplace. This paper reports on one of these research projects,
               a University and Industry collaboration between two of the
               largest off-site timber platform frame manufacturers in the UK.
               The paper explains how a needs analysis process was utilised to
               develop skills training content tailored to the immediate needs
               of the industry partners. It also explores how working with
               academia and a wider community of stakeholders allowed this
               training content to result in sector-level impact via knowledge
               exchange activities and generic skills material creation.

  author    = "King Chun, Chan and Li, Heng and Skitmore, Martin",
  abstract  = "PurposeThe construction industry is well known for its high
               accident rate and many practitioners consider a preventative
               approach to be the most important means of bringing about
               improvements. The purpose of this paper is to address previous
               research and the weaknesses of existing preventative approaches
               and then to describe and illustrate a new application involving
               the use of a multi‐dimensional simulation tool -- Construction
               Virtual Prototyping (CVP).Design/methodology/approachA
               literature review was conducted to investigate previous studies
               of hazard identification and safety management and to develop
               the new approach. Due to weaknesses in current practice, the
               research study explored the use of computer simulation
               techniques to create virtual environments where users can
               explore and identify construction hazards. Specifically, virtual
               prototyping technology was deployed to develop typical
               construction scenarios in which unsafe or hazardous incidents
               occur. In a case study, the users' performance was evaluated
               based on their responses to incidents within the virtual
               environment and the effectiveness of the computer simulation
               system established though interviews with the safety project
               management team.FindingsThe opinions and suggestions provided by
               the interviewees led to the initial conclusion that the

               team's hazard identification process during the early design
               stage.Originality/valueThe paper introduces an innovative method
               to support the management team's reviews of construction site
               safety. The system utilises three‐dimensional modelling and
               four‐dimensional simulation of worker behaviour, a configuration
               that has previously not been employed in construction
               simulations. An illustration of the method's use is also
               provided, together with a consideration of its strengths and

              about one million new homes were built- the Million Homes
              programme. These buildings constitute about one fourth of the
              entire Swedish building stock and thus have a high societal
              value. Today they do not always meet current building standards
              and many are in need of refurbishment. The Million Homes
              programme incorporated a large variety of technical building
              solutions, andknowledge about former building practices is needed
              if refurbishment is to be successful. Industrialised builders in
              Sweden have recognized the use of a platform as one means of
              sharing knowledge. A platform is essentially the collection of
              assets that are shared by a set of products. In a platform for
              housing refurbishment the assets have knowledge and process
              content (as opposed to product content) and will probably also
              contain many relationships. The interview study carried out as
              part of the research shows that the main purpose of a platform
              concept is to standardize components and processes. To increase
              the possibility that a platform concept for refurbishment of
              buildings will beused for knowledge sharing the focus should be
              on the individuals who will actually be sharing their knowledge
              and especially on social motivations. It is important that
              managers and leaders demonstrate knowledge sharing behaviors as
              this will lead to the establishment of a culture where knowledge
              sharing is the norm; in the context of this study this is
              especially important for the creation of an efficient platform
              concept for refurbishment.",

               immersive environment. The objective of this review is to
               critically collect and analyze the VR applications in CEET,
               aiming at all VR-related journal papers published from 1997 to

               technologies, applications and future directions through a
               systematic analysis. It is found that the VR technologies
               adopted for CEET evolve over time, from desktop-based VR,
               immersive VR, 3D game-based VR, to Building Information
               Modelling (BIM)-enabled VR. A sibling technology, Augmented
               Reality (AR), for CEET adoptions has also emerged in recent
               years. These technologies have been applied in architecture and
               design visualization, construction health and safety training,
               equipment and operational task training, as well as structural

               attention in many industries and have brought the potential to
               improve the efficiency of the construction industry. These facts
               led to the appearance of a new concept in construction industry
               called Construction 4.0. Therefore, this article seeks to
               explore the state of implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies
               in the construction industry and analyze their impact on the
               formation of the Construction 4.0 concept. In order to achieve
               the aim of this article, a literature review was conducted using
               the most relevant publication in this field. Moreover, authors
               carried out a bibliometric analysis among 195 selected research
               articles related to the Industry 4.0 and Construction 4.0 to
               identify interconnections between these concepts. The results
               show that Industry 4.0 has the greatest impact on productivity
               growth in construction and that interest in digital technologies
               is growing every year, but their penetration into the
               construction industry is currently slow and limited. The authors
               suggest that further research needs to be focused on future

               is engineer-to-order. House-builders can pre-engineer their
               design to different degrees, resulting in variations of the
               engineer-to-order strategy: design-to-order, adapt-to-order, and
               engineer-to-stock. This variation causes different settings for
               the use of platforms in house-building. The aim of this research
               is to diversify the engineer-to-order production strategy and
               its consequences for platform organization by studying its use
               in house-building. The multiple case study on four
               engineering/contractor firms reports the core capabilities for
               engineer-to-order firms: procurement and tendering, market
               knowledge, engineering, multi-skilled manufacturing, and
               coordination of sales and manufacturing. Design-to-order,
               adapt-to-order and engineer-to stock were shown to be production
               strategies in use in house-building. In design-to-order
               platforms parts of the platform are undefined while
               engineer-to-stock platforms are fully predefined. Coordination
               between market and manufacturing is a crucial capability when
               engaging in platform organization. When an engineering firm and
               a contractor collaborate to fulfil client needs, the
               coordination capability between market and manufacturing was
               shown to be low. The case study shows that specialized
               contractors who integrate the supply chain towards a specific
               market segment benefit fully from the platform concept, while
               contractors with a wider scope could focus on standardization of

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: There is a mismatch between the broad range of
                 learning theories offered in the wider education literature
                 and a relatively narrow range of theories privileged in the
                 medical education literature. The latter are usually described
                 under the heading of 'adult learning theory'. METHODS: This
                 paper critically addresses the limitations of the current
                 dominant learning theories informing medical education. An
                 argument is made that such theories, which address how an
                 individual learns, fail to explain how learning occurs in
                 dynamic, complex and unstable systems such as fluid clinical
                 teams. RESULTS: Models of learning that take into account
                 distributed knowing, learning through time as well as space,
                 and the complexity of a learning environment including
                 relationships between persons and artefacts, are more powerful
                 in explaining and predicting how learning occurs in clinical
                 teams. Learning theories may be privileged for ideological
                 reasons, such as medicine's concern with autonomy.
                 CONCLUSIONS: Where an increasing amount of medical education
                 occurs in workplace contexts, sociocultural learning theories
                 offer a best-fit exploration and explanation of such learning.
                 We need to continue to develop testable models of learning
                 that inform safe work practice. One type of learning theory
                 will not inform all practice contexts and we need to think
                 about a range of fit-for-purpose theories that are testable in
                 practice. Exciting current developments include dynamicist
                 models of learning drawing on complexity theory.",

                 radical pedagogical innovation in medical education in the UK
                 during the 1990s. Part of this thinking was to include the
                 medical humanities as a medium for re-thinking medical
                 practice, especially how medical students might better learn
                 to communicate with patients and colleagues, and how they
                 might become agents of change in progressing medicine through
                 innovations. In designing the curriculum, Cultural-historical
                 Activity Theory (CHAT) was used as a model to 'think', or
                 reconceptualise, the purposes of a curriculum. The first
                 question asked was: 'what do patients want?' Emphasis was
                 placed on resisting a 'will-to-stability' in adopting safe

  author   = "Gagg, Colin R",
  abstract = "Today, second only to water, concrete is the most consumed
              material, with three tonnes per year used for every person in the
              world. Twice as much concrete is used in construction as all
              other building materials combined. There is little doubt that
              concrete will remain in use as a construction material well into
              the future. However, with such extensive use of the material,
              discovery of any shortcoming or problem associated with concrete
              or reinforced concrete structures will become a matter of
              considerable public concern -- both from a safety perspective and
              associated costs of rectification. Accordingly, this paper will
              initially review the historic development of cements and concrete
              and will then focus on the mechanical response of concrete and
              reinforced concrete to its working environment. At appropriate
              points within the narrative, case study input will be used to
              illustrate or highlight principal themes.",

  title     = "Examining the Roles of Human Capital Theory. What next for
               Construction Industry?",
  author    = "Aliu, John and Aigbavboa, Clinton",
  abstract  = "The concept of human capital is very common in present-day
               construction industry with reference to its philosophy and
               techniques. Human capital (HC) is widely discussed in different
               fields; hence, its meanings differ from one field to another.
               This study provides a detailed discussion on the development of
               the human capital theory under various themes and sub-themes.
               The study further seeks to discuss the several effects of human
               capital development on industry success and competitiveness and
               how this contributes to economic growth in developing countries.
               Relevant literatures on HC theory and development were extracted
               from Scopus. Scopus is widely acknowledged as one of the widest
               interdisciplinary databases for engineering, technology, science
               and medicine. The Scopus database features over 20, 000+
               peer-reviewed journals from over 5000 publishers. The Scopus
               database allows its users to perform more detailed searching
               opportunities compared to other databases such as Academic
               Search Complete, Art and Architecture Complete, Ebsco Host,
               SpringerLink and Web of science. The distillation of literature
               through thematic analysis revealed the various roles of human
               capital and its correlation with construction industry success
               and growth. Findings from this study revealed that the success
               of the construction industry is firmly related to the
               effectiveness of its human capital. The study revealed that the
               human capital theory is not without its criticisms and barriers.
               Practically, this study explores the various benefits of human
               capital to employers of the construction industry. The study
               suggests that human capital development plays a key part in
               retaining quality employees and recruiting prospects.
               Furthermore, investment in human capital goes a long way in
               improving employee satisfaction, organisational culture and
               increased productivity. This study contributes to the human
               capital discourse, which is the measure of economic value
               provided by employees with reference to their abilities, skills,
               values and knowledge.",

  abstract = "The construction industry has traditionally been characterised by
              the high diversity of its agents and processes, high resistance
              to change and low incorporation of technology compared to
              manufacturing industries. However, the construction sector is
              experiencing now a strong renovation process in methodology and
              tools due to the incorporation of the Building Information
              Modelling, Lean Construction and Integrated Project Delivery.
              Meanwhile, in production systems, ``Industry 4.0'' is a new
              paradigm that proposes automation, monitoring, sensorisation,
              robotisation, and digitalisation to improve production and
              distribution processes. In this context, some authors have
              proposed the concept of ``Construction 4.0'' as the counterpart
              of Industry 4.0 for the construction sector, although the
              methodological-technological implications are not clear. This
              research shows a methodological-technological framework adapted
              to the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operations
              industry. This papers includes a detailed proposal for a
              reference frameworks and related technologies that could impact
              on this sector, responding to its complexities and specific
              challenges, such as the unique spaces for each work, which are
              difficult to standardise, arbitrary cost overruns and a
              productivity far below the average for other industries,
              increasing competitiveness and globalisation, as opposed to its
              traditionally local deployment, and an increasing demand to
              reduce the carbon footprint for all its activities.",

               Construction 4.0, coined in 2016 in Germany. Since its
               definition is still diffuse, it was deemed necessary to conduct
               a review on the publications in this field to grasp how this
               concept is being understood. For that purpose, a bibliometric
               analysis was conducted among 260 research articles using seven
               keywords. The results reveal that the number of publications is
               growing exponentially, with the USA, the UK, and China being
               leaders in this field; besides, four technologies are essential
               to understand Construction 4.0 at present time: 3D printing, big
               data, virtual reality, and Internet of Things. The results of
               this review suggest that further reviews should be conducted

  author    = "Dainty, Andrew R J and Bagilhole, Barbara M and Neale, Richard H",
  abstract  = "In response to impending skills shortages and changing
               employment patterns, the UK construction industry recently has
               made considerable efforts to attract more women to its
               professions. However, despite their increasing representation,
               there are indications that women experience difficulties in
               developing their careers within the industry. This research
               investigated the careers of men and women working for large
               construction companies, in order to establish the gender
               determined influences on women's career progression. A primarily
               qualitative methodology was employed for the research, in which
               career profiles were developed through ethnographic interviews
               with 41 matched pairs of male and female employees. This allowed
               the gender specific determinants of careers to be established
               across a range of different organizations, and from informants
               at different vocational and life-cycle stages. The analysis
               resulted in the formulation of a set of eight interrelated
               theoretical models, from which a theory of women's career
               development was constructed. The theory reflects the belief that
               the construction workplace is a competitive and conflictual
               environment, where women are overtly and covertly discriminated
               against by men, who use structural systems to undermine their
               participation. The women interviewed were found to have dealt
               with these barriers in a way which perpetuated existing work
               cultures. If reflected throughout the industry, this would
               suggest the existence of a self-fulfilling cycle of women's
               continued under-achievement. The paper puts forward the radical
               proposition that women should not be attracted to the industry
               unless steps are taken to moderate its exclusionary and
               discriminatory culture.",

               state where contemplated questions are of more value than hasty
               answers. For this reason, this paper is more concerned with
               theory formulation than theory testing. More specifically, it
               derives a grounded theory of construction crisis management
               which forms a useful basis for future research. It does so from
               an investigation of the complex patterns of communication and
               behaviour which emerge in response to construction crises. The
               conclusion is that construction crisis management is about the
               effective control of social and behavioural instability and the
               conflict which arises out of it. However, effective crisis
               management is made difficult by the in-built defence mechanisms
               which construction crises appear to have. The grounded theory
               also is contrasted with current crisis management theory and
               thereby, the uniqueness of crisis management in a construction
               context is identified.",

               meaningful characteristics of real?life events. Subsequent to
               data capture, data analysis will take place according to the

               certain information to be hidden within the data and diluted
               during this data analysis phase. In order to minimize this and
               to reveal informal aspects and freshly emerging themes from the
               case study data, it is proposed that there is great value in
               analysing case studies on various levels, through different

               applying multiple analyses involving different approaches, such

                 veterinary workplace clinical training (WCT), which occurs
                 just prior to students' graduation as competent veterinary
                 surgeons. The competency movement has strongly influenced

               study-based review and future pathways",
  author    = "Boafo, Fred and Kim, Jin-Hee and Kim, Jun-Tae",
  abstract  = "Even though tightened building energy efficiency standards are
               implemented periodically in many countries, existing buildings
               continually consume a momentous quota of the total primary
               energy. Energy efficiency solutions range from material
               components to bulk systems. A technique of building
               construction, referred to as prefabricated architecture
               (prefab), is increasing in reputation. Prefab encompasses the
               offsite fabrication of building components to a greater degree
               of finish as bulk building structures and systems, and their
               assembly on-site. In this context, prefab improves the speed of
               construction, quality of architecture, efficiency of materials,
               and worker safety, while limiting environmental impacts of
               construction, as compared to conventional site-built
               construction practices. Quite recently, a 57 story skyscraper
               was built in 19 days using prefabricated modules. From the
               building physics point of view, the bulk systems and tighter
               integration method of prefab minimizes thermal bridges. This
               study seeks to clearly characterize the levels of prefab and to
               investigate the performance of modular prefab; considering
               acoustic constrain, seismic resistance, thermal behavior, energy
               consumption, and life cycle analysis of existing prefab cases
               and, thus, provides a dynamic case study-based review.
               Generally, prefab can be categorized into components, panels
               (2D), modules (3D), hybrids, and unitized whole buildings. On
               average, greenhouse gas emissions from conventional construction
               were higher than for modular construction, not discounting some
               individual discrepancies. Few studies have focused on monitored
               data on prefab and occupants' comfort but additional studies are
               required to understand the public's perception of the
               technology. The scope of the work examined will be of interest
               to building engineers, manufacturers, and energy experts, as
               well as serve as a foundational reference for future study.",

                 argues that 'the social' does not exist as a single spatial
                 type, but rather performs itself in a recursive and
                 topologically heterogeneous manner. Using material drawn from
                 a study of the way in which tropical doctors handle anaemia,
                 it explores three different social topologies. First, there
                 are 'regions' in which objects are clustered together, and
                 boundaries are drawn round each cluster. Second, there are
                 'networks' in which distance is a function of relations
                 between elements, and difference a matter of relational
                 variety. These two forms of spatiality are often mobilized in
                 social theory. However, we argue that there are other kinds of
                 social space, and here consider the possible character of a
                 third, that of 'fluid spatiality'. In this, places are neither
                 delineated by boundaries, nor linked through stable relations:
                 instead, entities may be similar and dissimilar at different

               workforce could have at least 10\% of their work tasks affected
               by the introduction of GPTs, while around 19\% of workers may
               see at least 50\% of their tasks impacted. The influence spans
               all wage levels, with higher-income jobs potentially facing
               greater exposure. Notably, the impact is not limited to
               industries with higher recent productivity growth. We conclude
               that Generative Pre-trained Transformers exhibit characteristics
               of general-purpose technologies (GPTs), suggesting that as these

                 hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has demonstrated several
                 deficits in many aspects. However, no previous study employed
                 quantitative methodology providing objective measures that
                 could be compared among different studies with diverse
                 samples. To fill this gap, we used network analysis to
                 investigate how ADHD symptomatology impacts narrative
                 discourse, a complex linguistic task considered to be an
                 ecological measure of language. Fifty-eight adults (34 females
                 and 24 males) with a mean age of 26 years old and a mean of 17
                 years of educational level were administered the Adult
                 Self-Rating Scale for ADHD symptomatology. They also completed
                 the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Beck Depression
                 Inventory and the Urgency, Premeditation, Perseverance,
                 Sensation Seeking Behavior Scale. Intelligence quotient was
                 calculated. Individuals were asked to tell a story based on a
                 wordless picture book. Speech was recorded and transcribed as
                 an input to SpeechGraphs software. Parameters were total
                 number of words (TNW), number of loops of one node (L1),
                 repeated edges (RE), largest strongly connected component
                 (LSC) and average shortest path (ASP). Verbosity was
                 controlled. Statistical analysis was corrected for multiples
                 comparisons and partial correlations were performed for
                 confounding variables. After controlling for anxiety,
                 depression, IQ, and impulsiveness ADHD symptomatology was
                 positively correlated with L1 and negatively correlated with
                 LSC. TNW was positively correlated with ADHD symptoms. In a
                 subdomain analysis, both inattention and
                 hyperactivity-impulsivity were negatively correlated with LSC.
                 Only hyperactivity-impulsivity positively correlated with TNW
                 and L1. Results indicated a correlation between ADHD symptoms
                 and lower connectedness in narrative discourse (as indicated
                 by higher L1 and lower LSC), as well as higher total number of

                 importance, however, the malleability of this skill through
                 practice has scarcely been studied empirically, in contrast to
                 psychometric spatial ability. Thus, this article examines the
                 possibility of improving the accuracy of configurational
                 understanding of the environment by training. A total of 40
                 adults with a poor sense of direction participated in the
                 experiment; and were randomly assigned to either a condition
                 in which they received feedback only or a condition in which
                 they additionally practiced allocentric spatial updating.
                 Participants walked one route in each session, once a week for
                 6 weeks, and conducted spatial tasks designed to assess their
                 knowledge of the route. A total of 20 people with an average
                 sense of direction also participated as a comparison group.
                 Results showed that training in allocentric spatial updating
                 improved the accuracy of direction estimates, although the
                 size of the effect was limited: the improvement was not large
                 enough to equate the performance in the groups with a poor
                 versus average sense of direction. The two groups, however,
                 did not differ in spatial skill in mental rotation or path
                 integration. Feedback was effective for improving accuracy in
                 straight-line distance estimates and sketch maps: repeated
                 trials with feedback led to improved accuracy by the sixth
                 session to a level comparable to the group with an average
                 sense of direction. The results show that flexible translation
                 between viewer-centered and environment-centered
                 representations is difficult and not readily trainable, and
                 provide insights into the nature of individual differences in

  abstract = "Governments worldwide are taking actions to address the
              construction sector's sustainability concerns, including high
              carbon emissions, health and safety risks, low productivity, and
              increasing costs. Applying Industry 4.0 technologies to
              construction (also referred to as Construction 4.0) could address
              some of these concerns. However, current understanding about this
              is quite limited, with previous work being largely fragmented and
              limited both in terms of technologies as well as their
              interrelationships with the triple bottom line of sustainability
              perspectives. The focus of this article is therefore on
              addressing these gaps by proposing a comprehensive
              multi-dimensional Construction 4.0 sustainability framework that
              identifies and categorizes the key Construction 4.0 technologies
              and their positive and negative impacts on environmental,
              economic, and social sustainability, and then establishing its
              applicability/usefulness through an empirical, multimethodology
              case study assessment of the UAE's construction sector. The
              findings indicate Construction 4.0's positive impacts on
              environmental and economic sustainability that far outweigh its
              negative effects, although these impacts are comparable with
              regards to social sustainability. On Construction 4.0
              technologies itself, their application was found to be nonuniform
              with greater application seen for building information modeling
              and automation vis-{\`a}-vis others such as cyber-physical
              systems and smart materials, with significant growth expected in
              the future for blockchain- and three-dimensional-printing-related
              technologies. The proposed novel framework could enable the
              development of policy interventions and support mechanisms to
              increase Construction 4.0 deployment while addressing its
              negative sustainability-related impacts. The framework also has

              better understand the impact and how these sectors might be
              overcome.Design/methodology/approach This study adopted a
              sequential mixed qualitative and quantitative data collection and
              analysis approach. DT barriers were first identified from
              relevant literature and verified by an expert panel. Then, a
              questionnaire survey assessing the impacts of the identified DT
              barriers was distributed to construction professionals in China,
              and 192 valid responses were retrieved. Further, the data
              obtained were analyzed using ranking analysis, exploratory factor
              analysis (EFA), and partial least squares-structural equation
              modeling (PLS-SEM).Findings Based on the ranking analysis, the
              top three barriers are ``lack of industry-specific standards and

               verify theories that explain or predict human or organizational
               behavior. The design-science paradigm seeks to extend the
               boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating
               new and innovative artifacts. Both paradigms are foundational to
               the IS discipline, positioned as it is at the confluence of

  abstract    = "OBJECTIVE: Grounded theory (GT) is an established qualitative
                 research method, but few papers have encapsulated the
                 benefits, limits, and basic tenets of doing GT research on
                 user and provider experiences of health care services. GT can
                 be used to guide the entire study method, or it can be applied
                 at the data analysis stage only. METHODS: We summarize key
                 components of GT and common GT procedures used by qualitative
                 researchers in health care research. We draw on our experience
                 of conducting a GT study on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
                 patients' experiences of health care services. FINDINGS: We
                 discuss why some approaches in GT research may work better
                 than others, particularly when the focus of study is
                 hard-to-reach population groups. We highlight the flexibility
                 of procedures in GT to build theory about how people engage
                 with health care services. CONCLUSION: GT enables researchers
                 to capture and understand health care experiences. GT methods
                 are particularly valuable when the topic of interest has not
                 previously been studied. GT can be applied to bring structure

  abstract  = "Purpose The purpose of this paper is to understand if and how
               industrialized house building (IHB) could support productivity
               developments for housebuilding on project and industry levels.
               The take is that fragmentation of construction is one
               explanation for the lack of productivity growth, and that IHB
               could be an integrating method of overcoming horizontal and
               vertical fragmentation. Design/methodology/approach Singe-factor
               productivity measures are calculated based on data reported by
               IHB companies and compared to official produced and published
               research data. The survey covers the years 2013--2020 for IHB
               companies building multi-storey houses in timber. Generalization
               is sought through descriptive statistics by contrasting the data
               samples to the used means to control vertical and horizontal
               fragmentation formulated as three theoretical propositions.
               Findings According to the results, IHB in timber is on average
               more productive than conventional housebuilding at the company
               level, project level, in absolute and in growth terms over the
               eight-year period. On the company level, the labour productivity
               was on average 10\% higher for IHB compared to general
               construction and positioned between general construction and
               general manufacturing. On the project level, IHB displayed an
               average cost productivity growth of 19\% for an employed
               prefabrication degree of about 45\%. Originality/value Empirical
               evidence is presented quantifying so far perceived advantages of
               IHB. By providing analysis of actual cost and project data
               derived from IHB companies, the article quantifies previous
               research that IHB is not only about prefabrication. The observed
               positive productivity growth in relation to the employed
               prefabrication degree indicates that off-site production is not
               a sufficient mean for reaching high productivity and
               productivity growth. Instead, the capabilities to integrate the
               operative logic of conventional housebuilding together with
               logic of IHB platform development and use is a probable
               explanation of the observed positive productivity growth.",

              wanting to start thematic analysis, or conduct it in a more
              deliberate and rigorous way, and consider potential pitfalls in
              conducting thematic analysis. Finally, we outline the
              disadvantages and advantages of thematic analysis. We conclude by
              advocating thematic analysis as a useful and flexible method for
              qualitative research in and beyond psychology. (PsycINFO Database

  abstract  = "[Pierre Bourdieu suggests that his concept of habitus should be
               seen as a method; a way of thinking about the social world which
               invites an understanding of everyday practices as constitutive
               of social differences. The appeal of habitus lies in its ability
               to uncover social inequalities in a way that keeps agency and
               structure simultaneously in focus. However, there are also
               problems in operationalising habitus, chiefly because of the
               indeterminacy of the concept. In order to overcome these
               difficulties I have outlined four key components of habitus and
               attempted to delineate the aspects of habitus as method that
               seem most relevant to primary classrooms. Finally, drawing on
               ethnographic data gathered over 15 months of participant
               observation in two primary classrooms, the article seeks to
               explore through the lens of habitus how differences of gender,
               'race' and class are produced by children in primary classrooms.
               Although I make no claims for my own empirical work it does
               suggest that habitus as method has the potential to reveal the
               taken-for-granted inequalities embedded in everyday practices.]",

               have occupied the academic literature for decades. Those arguing
               in favor plead for greater rigor and clarity to determine ``what
               works.'' Those arguing against protest that education is a
               complex, social endeavor and that for epistemological,
               theoretical and political reasons it is not possible to state,
               with any useful degree of generalizable certainty, ``what
               works.'' While academics argue, policy and practice in Higher
               Education are beset with problems. Ineffective methods such as
               ``Learning Styles'' persist. Teaching quality and teacher
               performance are measured using subjective and potentially biased
               feedback. University educators have limited access to
               professional development, particularly for practical teaching
               skills. There is a huge volume of higher education research, but
               it is disconnected from educational practice. Change is needed.
               We propose a pragmatic model of Evidence-Based Higher Education,
               empowering educators and others to make judgements about the
               application of the most useful evidence, in a particular
               context, including pragmatic considerations of cost and other
               resources. Implications of the model include a need to emphasize
               pragmatic approaches to research in higher education, delivering
               results that are more obviously useful, and a pragmatic focus on
               practical teaching skills for the development of educators in

  abstract  = "One of the issues organizations face is identifying the required
               skills needed for a position and then evaluating whether their
               personnel have these skills or if there is a ``skills gap.'' For
               this research, the authors are defining the ``skills gap'' as
               the distance between the position requirements and the skills
               currently possessed by the worker in that position. While
               multiple models have been created over the years to address
               facets of the problem, none of them provide a comprehensive
               framework to clearly identify the required skills and worker
               qualifications and then evaluate the degree of similarity. A
               composite skills gap model has been developed using the design
               science research method (DSRM) to combine elements of previous
               models and to ensure that the resulting model met a set of
               established criteria. The skills gap analysis model (SGAM) was
               evaluated using demonstration data to ensure that it provided a
               single taxonomy, for both position requirements and the worker
               qualifications, the resulting descriptions were quantifiable and
               comparable, the data was accurate and actionable, the model
               framework is adaptable to any domain, and it is easy to use and
               not time consuming. The framework provided by the SGAM model
               establishes a theoretical foundation for skills gap analyses
               that allows for more analytical research in this area. By
               utilizing the SGAM to identify position requirements and worker

               better-suited positions or utilize needed training in the
               specific areas identified. As technology moves toward increasing
               automation, robotics and artificial intelligence, this type of
               model can identify what skills are necessary for ``retooling''

  abstract  = "PurposePrime contractors spend up to 90 per cent of a
               construction project's turnover on buying goods and services,
               and thus suppliers have a large impact on project performance.
               Therefore, the purchasing function management of the prime
               contractor has a large influence on the overall performance: the
               more developed (i.e. mature or professional) this function is,
               the greater its positive contribution. The purpose of this paper
               is to develop and test a quick scan purchasing maturity tool by
               applying a design science research
               method.Design/methodology/approachThe maturity tool is developed
               by applying Hevner's framework for design science research. In
               this framework, foundations drawn from the available knowledge
               base are used to develop the new tool. Scientific justification
               of this new tool and approval of its approach for construction
               practice is obtained through testing it in the specific context
               of a case company.FindingsThe tool provides a company with
               insight into its current level of purchasing maturity and
               possibilities for improving performance by increasing this
               level.Originality/valueThe conciseness and the limited time

                 that the different variants of GT incorporate a core set of

                 articulated as the principles of (1) taking the word
                 ``grounded'' seriously, (2) capturing and explaining
                 context-related social processes, (3) pursuing theory through

                 there are important differences among them, which implies that
                 researchers need to make careful choices when using grounded

               here was to investigate whether industrialized house-building
               characteristics could be a step toward a smart factory for
               wooden house builders. In this paper, ideas of the smart wooden
               house factory are synthesized, and challenges for the
               single-family wooden house builder are identified. The study is
               founded on empirical data from one single-case study. A
               challenge identified was the maturity level of the culture and
               organization to commit to and utilize modern technology and
               modern working methods. The concept of the smart wooden house
               factory is still in its infancy and needs further research.",

                 production of knowledge. Related to qualitative research
                 methods, a variety of approaches have been set forth in the
                 literature using the terms conceptual framework, theoretical
                 framework, paradigm, and epistemology. While these approaches
                 are helpful in their own context, we summarize and distill
                 them in order to build upon the case that a balanced and
                 centered use of the theoretical framework can bolster the
                 qualitative approach. Our project builds on the arguments that
                 epistemology and methodological rigor are essential by adding
                 the notion that the influence of theory permeates almost every
                 aspect of the study---even if the author does not recognize
                 this influence. Compilers of methodological approaches have
                 referred to the use of theory as analogous to a coat closet in
                 which different items can be housed or a lens through which
                 the literature and data in the study are viewed. In this

                 diagram of the qualitative project that points to the central
                 role of a theoretical framework. We also caution against the

              ``Participatory Qualitative Research.'' In recent years there has
              been a resurgence of interest in participatory research
              strategies. The articles in this special issue come from
              different disciplines. Against the background of concrete
              empirical research projects, they address numerous conceptual
              considerations and methodological approaches. After reading the
              contributions, and engaging with the authors' arguments, we were
              prompted to focus in particular on those areas in which further
              work needs to be done. They include, on the one hand, fundamental
              principles of participatory research, such as democratic-theory
              considerations, the concept of ``safe space,'' participation
              issues, and ethical questions. And, on the other hand, we focus
              on practical research considerations regarding the role and tasks
              of the various participants; specific methodological approaches;
              and quality criteria---understood here in the sense of arguments
              justifying a participatory approach. Our aim is to stimulate a
              broad discussion that does not focus only on participatory
              research in the narrower sense. Because participatory methodology
              poses certain knowledge- and research-related questions in a

              its applications. I shall introduce a new scheme for modes of
              recontextualisation that enables the analysis of the ways in
              which one activity -- which might be school mathematics or social
              research or any empirically observed regularity of practice --
              recontextualises the practice of another and I shall also
              present, deploy, and develop an existing scheme -- domains of
              action -- in an analysis of school mathematics examination papers
              and in the structuring of what I refer to as the esoteric domain.
              This domain is here conceived as a hybrid domain of, first,
              linguistic and extralinguistic resources that are unambiguously
              mathematical in terms of both expression and content and, second,
              pedagogic theory -- often tacit -- that enables the mathematical
              gaze onto other practices and so recontextualises them. A second
              and more general theme that runs through the paper is the claim
              that there is nothing that is beyond semiosis, that there is
              nothing to which we have direct access, unmediated by
              interpretation. This state of affairs has implications for

              mathematical semiotic system is under continuous development --
              the curriculum never being graspable all at once -- understanding
              -- as a stable semiotic moment -- of any aspect or object of
              mathematics is always localised to the individual and is at best
              transient, and the sequencing of such moments may well also be
              more individualised than consistent in some correspondence with
              the sequencing of the curriculum. This being the case, a
              concentration on understanding as a goal may well serve to
              inhibit the pragmatic acquisition and deployment of mathematical
              technologies, which should be the principal aim of mathematics
              teaching and learning. The paper is primarily concerned with
              mathematics education. SAM, however, is a language that is
              available for recruiting and deploying in potentially any context

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: According to Dweck and colleagues, praise can be
                 delivered using person ('you are clever') or process terms
                 ('you worked hard'). Research suggests that giving people
                 process praise after success can help them deal better with
                 subsequent failures because it attributes outcomes to effort
                 rather than fixed ability. However, research has thus far
                 inadequately addressed how these types of praise compare to
                 receiving no evaluative feedback. AIM: The aim of the present
                 research was to examine the effects of person and process
                 praise compared to a control group where only objective
                 outcome feedback was given. SAMPLES: In Study 1, 145 British
                 school children aged 9-11 years took part. In Study 2,
                 participants were 114 British university students. METHOD: In
                 both studies, participants read three scenarios and were asked
                 to imagine themselves as the main character. In each scenario,
                 they succeeded in an educational task and received either
                 person, process, or no praise. Participants then read two
                 scenarios, where they failed at a task. Following each
                 scenario participants evaluated their performance, affect, and
                 persistence. RESULTS: After one failure, participants who
                 received person praise reacted most negatively on all
                 dependent measures. However, those in the process condition
                 did not differ significantly from those in the control group.
                 CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that process feedback may
                 not be inherently positive; instead person feedback seems
                 particularly detrimental.",

               current skills gap in both generic and skill areas within the
               construction industry in Queensland, Australia.
               Design/methodology/approach -- An internet-based survey was
               administered to collect the opinions of construction employees
               about the workplace-training environment and their perceptions
               towards training. The survey intended to address the following
               research questions, specifically in relation to the construction
               industry. Findings -- The survey results reveal that whilst
               overall participation in workplace training is high, the current
               workplace training environments do not foster balanced skill
               development. The study reveals that in the current absence of a
               formal and well-balanced training mechanism, construction
               workers generally resort to their own informal self-development
               initiatives to develop the needed role-specific theoretical
               knowledge. Research limitations/implications -- The findings of
               the research are based on the data primarily collected in the
               construction industry in Queensland, Australia. The data are
               limited to a single Tier 2 construction company. Practical
               implications -- The findings of this study can be utilised to
               suggest improvements in the current (or develop new) workplace
               training initiatives. Social implications -- The research
               suggests that workplace training has positive relationship with
               career growth. The results suggest that in the construction
               industry, employees are generally well aware of the importance
               of workplace training in their career development and they
               largely appreciate training as being a critical factor for
               developing their capacity to perform their roles successfully,
               and to maintain their employability. Originality/value -- This
               paper is unique as it investigates the current skills gap in
               both generic and skill areas within the construction industry in
               Queensland, Australia. So far no work has been undertaken to
               identify and discusses the main method of workplace learning
               within the Tier 2 industry in the context of Queensland

               of four different strategies for teaching three to four year old
               children how to master a difficult construction task. These
               strategies were derived from previous studies of mother-child
               and experimenter-child interactions in an assisted learning
               situation. One strategy the 'contingent approach' was based
               primarily on theoretical considerations and when used in earlier
               work as a basis for describing and evaluating maternal teaching
               it enabled us to predict how well children taught by their
               mothers would do with a task after instruction. The three other
               strategies are idealised versions of the teaching methods used
               by less successful mothers-as-teachers. On the basis of our
               analysis of effective instruction it is possible to predict how
               well children taught by these four different techniques by a
               trained instructor should perform after instruction.The present
               study largely confirms these predictions. In so doing, it
               strengthens the supposition that it was maternal behaviour in
               the earlier work which influenced the children's task abilities
               and it also corroborates various hypotheses about the essential
               nature of effective face-to-face instruction.",

               a virtual reality driving simulator capable of conveying haptic
               and visual messages to promote eco-sustainable driving behavior.
               The driving simulator was implemented through the Unity game
               engine; a large street environment, including high-speed and
               urban sections, was created to examine different driving
               behaviors. The hardware setup included a gaming driving seat,
               equipped with a steering wheel and pedals; the virtual scenarios
               were displayed through an Oculus Rift headset to guarantee an
               immersive experience. Haptic stimulation (i.e., vibrations) was
               delivered to the driver through the accelerator pedal, while
               visual stimuli (i.e., icons and colors) were shown on a virtual
               head-up display. The sensory feedbacks were presented both alone
               and in combination, providing information about excessive
               acceleration and speed. Four different virtual scenarios, each
               one including a distracting element (i.e., navigator, rain,
               call, and traffic), were also created. Ten participants tested
               the simulator. Fuel consumption was evaluated by calculating a
               mean power index (MPI) in reference to the sensory feedback
               presentation; physiological reactions and responses to a
               usability survey were also collected. The results revealed that
               the haptic and visuo-haptic feedback were responsible for an MPI
               reduction, respectively, for 14\% and 11\% compared with a
               condition of no feedback presentation; while visual feedback
               alone resulted in an MPI increase of 11\%. The efficacy of
               haptic feedback was also accompanied by a more relaxing
               physiological state of the users, compared with the visual
               stimulation. The system's usability was adequate, although
               haptic stimuli were rated slightly more intrusive than the
               visual ones. Overall, these preliminary results highlight how
               promising the use of the haptic channel can be in communicating
               and guiding the driver toward a more eco-sustainable behavior.",

  abstract  = "Disruptive technologies offer avenues to significantly improve
               the performance of construction project delivery. While the
               construction industry is often labeled as conservative and
               unimaginative with regard to technology adoption, significant
               strides have been made in recent years  specifically, the use
               of Building Information Modeling (BIM) for information storage,
               distribution and communication, as well as Lean construction
               techniques such as production planning and control (PPC). While
               the implementation of these innovative technologies and
               practices individually improve project performance, integrating
               them together can provide still greater benefits. BIM is
               certainly useful, but it alone is not a satisfactory answer to
               the paradox: how does one design and visualize a 3D product in a
               2D space? Augmented Reality (AR) is a disruptive technology that
               can help address this challenge. AR is both an aggregator of
               information and an information publishing platform which allows
               users a spectrum of capabilities to 1) passively view displayed
               information, 2) actively engage and interact with published
               content, and 3) collaborate with others in real time from remote
               locations. No extant research effort has comprehensively
               investigated the opportunities and benefits of the integrated
               use of AR, BIM, and Lean in the planning process to improve
               project performance. This paper addresses precisely this
               research gap. Using insights gained from real-world construction
               projects, this paper examines the current state of production
               strategy process (PSP) development  an integral part of PPC,
               identifies pain-points and opportunities for process
               re-engineering using AR, and develops an AR-enabled PSP future
